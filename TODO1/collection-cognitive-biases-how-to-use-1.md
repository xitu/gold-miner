# 84 cognitive biases you should exploit to design better products - Part 1

![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JvOvFjdlVfE/XMhvVVa0R4I/AAAAAAAAPrM/KaVBcSKDdPgb1PLug4TlVOx07uY6YHShQCLcBGAs/s640/Cognitive%2Bbiases.png)

This one is probably my longest post in my 15 years of blogging, and the result of occasional writing I've been doing in the past few months.

**Cognitive biases** are systematic errors in our thinking process that affect our decisions making.

As humans, we don‚Äôt always see things as they really are, or remember things as they really were. As a result, we create our own subjective social reality that affects our judgment.

> As **product people**, we **should** to take advantage of these biases to create better products.

Not in a bad way of course, but in a way that will allow us to get a fair chance to prove that our products are worthy. Products can exploit common cognitive biases to establish trust with the users, improve conversion rates, increase their users‚Äô engagement level, and as a result, improve retention rates.

Because at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all in the packaging, and being 100% accurate and concise is simply not enough to persuade the users to give the product a chance or to try out its‚Äô new features.

Users need more than that, and that‚Äôs exactly where **cognitive biases** can (and should) be used.

Now, I have to warn you: this list is freaking long; it includes over 80 different biases - from biases we need to **avoid**, to biases we can **leverage** to improve our product's onboarding process, increase conversion rates, improve retention and generate more revenue. 

Luckily for you, I created **over 40 visual UI/UX examples** that will make it easier for you to skim through the list. Oh no, don't thank me! I'm just doing my job...

### Who should read this list?¬†

I believe **product managers**, **marketing managers**, and **entrepreneurs** will find this list extremely useful and relevant, but in fact, anyone who deals with **software development** might find something to relate to in this list. It helps everyone involved, understand the psychology behind users behavior and how to use it to build better products.

Oh, and just to be clear, I did not invent these biases, I just collected them whenever I needed them in my work, and if you happen to disagree with some of them or think they don‚Äôt work, that‚Äôs probably because you are unique (or you may suffer from the Dunning-Kruger Effect as described below üòâ).

OK, that turned out to be a pretty long opening. Let's begin:

## Superficial, are we?

The way the information is presented has a big impact on the way we think and make decisions.

Sure, we say we are not superficial, but when it comes to products, the packaging plays a significant role.

### 1. Streetlight Effect

We tend to search for things where it's easiest to look.

As the joke says: A policeman sees a drunk man searching for his wallet under a streetlight and asks: "_is this where you lost it?_", and the drunk replies, "_no, I lost it in the park, but this is where the light is_".

**Product tip**: Whatever answers you are looking for: product, marketing, user satisfaction or anything else - dig deeper. Many answers are not where "the light" is, and analyzing data is often much harder than just collecting it.

### 2. Perceived Value Bias

We perceive the value of a product or service based on how it looks or how it‚Äôs served.

As they say: it‚Äôs all in the packaging!

**Product tip**: Design is more important for the success of your product than you think. That extra space, wrong border color, and misaligned text - they all impact your conversion rates.

Make your UI design a priority.

![Perceived Value Bias - we perceive the value of a product or service based on how they look](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1pmZD59AgSE4oMG0lffF4T2X_zvYhwB54 "Perceived Value Bias - we perceive the value of a product or service based on how they look")

Small UI corrections make a big impact

### 3. Picture Superiority Effect

Pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than (a thousand) words.

**UI¬†tip**: Always include images in your content. If you sell products or services - great visuals will improve your conversion rates.

### 4. Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)

When multiple homogeneous objects are presented together, the object that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.

**Design¬†tip**: Make sure the CTA button stands out using a different style, size, color, and position.

![Von Restorff Effect - Make sure your CTA button stands out](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1EgHJ7W7O6bSIQihEHweO8Mp5IjI7a1gZ "Von Restorff Effect - Make sure your CTA button stands out")

Make sure your CTA buttons stand out

## More conservative than we think

We say we are innovative, we like to try new technologies, but when it comes to core instincts and quick decision making - we aim to minimize risks and stick with the things we're already familiar with.

### 5. Status Quo Bias

We tend to prefer a status quo over a change.

The current baseline is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.

### 6. Endowment Effect

Once we own something, we value it higher than we did before we owned it.

As a result, we are more likely to retain an object we own than to acquire that same object if we don‚Äôt own it.

Product tip: Free trials are the most common use of the endowment effect.

Once users¬†commit to a certain product and invest time in it (i.e. build their profile etc.) it‚Äôs harder for them to let go and not upgrade their plan when the trial ends.

**Onboarding tip**: Find ways for people to play with your product before signing up.

**Retention tip**: When a customer leaves you, provide examples of all the good things they‚Äôll lose.

### 7. IKEA Effect

We place a disproportionately high value on products we created (or worked hard for).

**Product tip**: let your users do something as part of the onboarding process (not too hard, but rewarding) so they can connect with your product.

### 8. Mere-Exposure Effect (Familiarity Principle)

We tend to develop a preference for things we are familiar with.

**UI tip**: Stick with familiar UI concepts, behavior, terms, signs and icons.

Be consistent across your marketing materials, website and product to optimize the funnel.

**UX Writing tip**: Align with the industry jargon.¬†Make¬†sure your users feel comfortable.

![Mere-Exposure Effect - Stick with the UI standards](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1EPMg0K3076dsm2utSSKlAa4wMT-ig6H- "Mere-Exposure Effect - Stick with the UI standards")

Stick with the standards¬†

### 9. Functional Fixedness

We tend to use objects in the traditional way they were used.

**Usability tip**: When your product challenges an existing usage tradition - it may cause some usability challenges. Keep them in mind and try to solve them in advance.

### 10. Law of Instrument (Maslow's Hammer)

We tend to over-rely on tools we are familiar with, even in the presence of much better options.

As they say: ‚Äú_To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail_‚Äù

![To a man with a hammer - everything looks like a nail](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1NY8VZMcyZ9YBywLokF0wGnudItR-ZF_a "To a man with a hammer - everything looks like a nail")

## Don‚Äôt call me a loser

We hate losing more than we like winning.¬†The right message (at the right timing) might turn on¬†this aversion and push¬†us to make a biased decision.

### 11. Loss Aversion

We prefer not to lose $100 than to win $100 because the value of losing something is higher than the value of getting it (which is pretty consistent with the Endowment effect described above).

**UX Writing tip**: Use negative terms to express the potential loss: ‚Äústop wasting money‚Äù.

**Product tip**: Limit your special deals (inside and outside your product) to create a sense of urgency: ‚Äúthis exclusive deal ends in¬†x hours‚Äù.

![Loss Aversion - help your users avoid losses](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1-mEYTiDKektNhEGo5lOvz1w9oKrXYyoD "Loss Aversion - help your users avoid losses")

Help your users avoid losses

### 12. Zero-Risk Bias:

We love certainty even if it's counterproductive.

**Product tip**: offer money-back guarantee and risk-free trials to reduce the level of risks and make your customers feel secure.

![Zero-Risk Bias - Make sure all possible concerns are well addressed](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1pCFDq4W6nO7hR7HuCx9mIvqPiqu3y3Hm "Zero-Risk Bias - Make sure all possible concerns are well addressed")

Make sure all possible concerns are addressed

### 13. Neglect of Probability

When we are under pressure, we fail to think of the probability of risks to happen.

As a result, minor risks might get¬†overrated or neglected.

**Product rule**: during a conversion funnel - smallest uncertainties might cause the user to mistrust your product and stop. Make sure all details are clear and presented upfront.

Especially the ones that involve money such as the total cost, discounts (if exists), additional costs.

![Neglect of Probability - Make sure to remove uncertainties in your product](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1tN2psH2vXjV6zgWBEjMouOFSi_A-ikxX "Neglect of Probability - Make sure to remove uncertainties in your product")

Clear uncertainties proactively

### 14. Scarcity Effect

We place a higher value on an object that is scarce¬†and a lower value on an object that is highly available.

The fear of missing out (FOMO) makes us more vulnerable to temptation and impulse and pushes us to make rush decisions.

**Product tip**: decorate your products and services with ‚Äúlimited time offers‚Äù, ‚Äúlimited quantity‚Äù, etc

Create the impression that many others are watching this item ‚Äúright now!‚Äù and about to grab the last remaining items any minute.

![Creating scarcity effect in UI](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=15rOsh1pZOJQE_4Wb4LKFVxARJdwUpO7x "Creating scarcity effect in UI")

Or, as Booking.com would probably use it:

![Scarcity Effect - the drastic approach (as can be seen in well-known hotel booking apps](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1UmHrLdiyYGZhzvKGIw_etlOB-qAzveol "Scarcity Effect - the drastic approach (as can be seen in well-known hotel booking apps")

### 15. The Simulation Heuristic

We determine the likelihood of an event to happen based on how easy it is to picture the event mentally. As a result, "near misses" are more disappointing than other failures.

**Product tip**: Send a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù email to users that almost completed an important action in your product, but eventually didn‚Äôt. Let them know they are very close, and that the opportunity is still waiting for them.

## Disproportionately emotional

We try to make rational decisions, but sometimes our emotions are just¬†stronger than we think.

### 16. Negativity Bias

We give more weight to bad experiences than to good ones.

1 Negative Emotion = 3 x Positive Emotion

![Negativity Bias: 1 negative emotion equals 3 positive ones](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1I8QoTHbfkB8tgLa0WMI1NRZpYM5hcZaF "Negativity Bias: 1 negative emotion equals 3 positive ones")

**Product/marketing tip**: Illustrate your product value by the negative experience it resolves.

If you hope your story to make an impact or even go viral - try emotionally negative content.

![Negativity Bias - Illustrate your product value by the negative experience it resolves.](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=18_tQrUfk6v_Q6Y3IY4QrIfIvraHYRrXP "Negativity Bias - Illustrate your product value by the negative experience it resolves.")

Illustrate the value of your product by emphasizing the negative experience it resolves¬†

### 17. Base Rate Fallacy (Base Rate Neglect)

We tend to ignore general information and focus on specific cases.

How to use: don‚Äôt just share cold information about your product. Instead, show testimonials, use cases, from people or companies others can relate with.

**Work-related tip**: If you want to be more convincing - blend your quantified data with some individual stories. Use quantified data to support your opinion rationally. The specific examples will convey your message emotionally.

> If you want to be more convincing - blend your quantified data with some individual stories. Use quantified data to support your opinion rationally. The specific examples will convey your message emotionally.

### 18. Identifiable Victim Effect

We tend to empathize more with a specific individual than with a large anonymous group.

**How to use it**: When you are telling the story of your product, use personal stories of individuals instead of generic statements.

![Identifiable Victim Effect - Use personal stories of individuals instead of generic statements. ](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1NZQMHBv_55MqCmi9ggDqCaLkDd31umgW "Identifiable Victim Effect - Use personal stories of individuals instead of generic statements. ")

Use personal stories instead of generic statements

### 19. Likability Effect

We like people who like the same things we do.

As an example, if you were to tell me you‚Äôre a Transformers fan - I would immediately count you as a¬†friend.

**Marketing tip**: Show the strengths of your product by using testimonials of customers who faced similar issues as other potential customers.

Make sure to use the authentic language customers are using - say it in their own words.

### 20. The Focusing Effect

We attribute too much weight to events of the past and translate them into future expectations.

### 21. Impact Bias

We tend to overestimate the length or the intensity of future emotional states.

It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never get over her!‚Äù bias.

**Possible usage**: Paint a picture of the users without your product or service, and later, introduce your product with how it will solve those pains.
