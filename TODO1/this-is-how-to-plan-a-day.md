# This Is How To Plan A Day.

#### Banish anxiety and overwhelm on busy days

I am going out of town with my family tomorrow.

I have a lot to get done before we step on the plane.

I woke up with my mind spinning on repeat: work, write, errands, kids, meals, cleaning, dog. All the things I want or need to do today. Over and over. I knew I was overwhelmed by this day.

So I planned it out.

And now I know, I have 1 1/2 hours to write this morning. Plus a cushion later tonight to re-read and edit. And I know exactly when I am doing all my other tasks. And which nagging little activities don’t really need to get done today.

The best part of planning the day is that **I am not wasting time with anxiety about when I will get it all done**. Because I already know.

Here is how I do it:

#### Make a List

I wrote down all the crazy things that were in my head. It actually wasn’t as much as I thought. When you think of the same things over and over, it feels like the tornado from the Wizard of Oz. When you write them down on a piece of paper, you realize the volume of your to-do’s amounts to a strong breeze.

Here’s the kicker: **the list only took me a minute or two.**

I did come back to it a few minutes later to make sure I didn’t miss anything. But making the list takes no time at all. Because it was right on the tip of my brain already.

#### Decide How Long Each Thing Takes

Some things on your list will take 15 minutes or less. I group those things together. In my case, its things like putting the mail on hold while we are out of town. Little odds and ends. I will group those things together.

Then there are longer things. Writing. Finishing up the last pieces of a consulting project. Those each need at least an hour if not several hours. Because I only have one work project left, I know that I can spend the whole “work” time slot on the one thing, which helps.

So, I **wrote down on my list how long each thing will take**. And grouped together the shorter items that I can do in the same location.

Again, this step only took me a few minutes.

#### Determine The Open Time Slots of The Day

Right now, I have a few hours that are open. At 4p, I have to pick my kids up from camp. We usually hang out after camp or school and then have dinner between 5:30–6p. My kids have been going to bed pretty late, around 9p. But after dinner my husband usually does something with them, like throw a baseball. So, I know that 4–7p will not be a good time for tasks, because I will be with my family. But after 7p, I have some “wiggle room” for things that are not quite done.

That means I need to get the bulk of my activities done between now and 3:45p (when I need to leave the house for camp pickup).

**That still gives me 6 hours to complete everything.**

Six hours sounds like a lot of time.

Once again, this step only took me a few minutes.

#### Schedule Each Activity

Finally, I figure out the best time slot for each activity.

For me, whatever feels most urgent or necessary, I schedule it first. Today, its all the little odds and ends that I need to do. Most of them involve computer tasks and phone calls. So, I will do those first. All together, they should take about an hour. So, I’ll plan for 1 hour and 15 minutes, just in case. You never know how long I might be on hold.

Next, I want to finish that work project. It isn’t actually due until next week, but I know I don’t want to work on it on vacation. So, I will finish it today and not have to worry about it. It should take about 2 hours. I will do that next.

I plan 20 minutes for lunch.

After that, I will do some writing. I want to be “in the moment” when on vacation with my family, so I am unsure about my writing frequency next week. I want to finish a piece today. I will spend 1.5 hours working on my writing. And then if needed, re-read, revise, and edit after 7p this evening. With the goal of publishing tonight or tomorrow.

For writing, **I also need to set a timer**. Writing puts me in a deep state of “flow”, where I am engaged and lose track of time. So, I set a timer on my phone and go ahead and write. I don’t have to keep looking at the clock. I know that my phone will tell me when I need to move to the next task.

Finally, its all the errands that take me out of the house. I have about an hour left for those, and can pick my my kids on the way home from them.

As I put the schedule together, I realize that an hour might not be enough time to complete all the errands. So I plan to first do the errands that I should do without my kids. For errands like a trip to Target, I can bring my kids along after I pick them up. We should still be home by 5p, plenty of time for dinner.

Which reminds me, there is no time for me today to cook dinner. So I need to plan to either pick something up or find a decent order-in option. But, I know that is the case, and dinner won’t surprise me at the end of the day.

This part took me a little longer. Its a little bit like putting a puzzle together.

But **it was still less than 15 minutes**.

#### Take a Deep Breath. Then Execute.

And there is my day. From beginning to end, **the entire day took about 20 minutes to schedule**. And now I don’t have to spend time worrying about it.

I know exactly what I can and can’t do, and when. I know that there is time to get it all done. And anything that didn’t make this list can wait until after vacation.

**Most important, this day no longer overwhelms me.** My mind is not racing. I can focus on execution.

---

For me, **scheduling a day is a substantial anxiety reliever**. Once I started doing this, I realized that I was wasting hours every day worrying. Thinking about getting things done without actually making progress on anything. Worrying can be a massive time suck.

I like to schedule in the morning, one day at a time, on a plain piece of paper, post-it, or in my notebook.

I tried fancy planners and planning out a whole week in advance. **That triggered my perfectionism**. I felt beholding to the week’s plan if I did the whole thing in advance, and it felt confining, not relaxing. And if I missed one thing on the schedule, the whole week went into the garbage.

But everyone is different. I have anxiety and perfectionism, so too much structure can feel punishing.

The point is to use this as a guideline and find your own way to get a handle on your overwhelm. We all have a lot to do. Keep trying different things. Something will work for you.
