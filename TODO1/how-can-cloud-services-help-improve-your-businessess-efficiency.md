> Going over IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, and FaaS

In the 20th century, companies relied on servers and computers that were on the premises.

This meant when new servers had to be spun up, it could take weeks or even months to get everything set up. From getting the budget approved, to putting out orders, to having servers shipped and then installed — it was a long and arduous process.

But times have changed and the concept of companies having millions of dollars of unused servers on-site has been replaced by cloud computing services.

Simply put, cloud computing is a remote service that takes the form of infrastructure, software, storage, platforms, and a host of others.

## Why Do Companies Invest In Cloud Computing Like AWS And Azure?

The variety of services offered allows companies to not only reduce their technical hardware costs but also their employee costs. Much of what used to require a whole team of engineers can now be done by one or two developers.

With all the variety, it can be difficult to keep track of all the possible options for cloud service types — let’s take a look at what’s available.

## Types of Cloud Computing Services

#### IaaS — what is it?

IaaS, or Infrastructure-as-a-Service, is a service model that works as a pool of virtual or physical infrastructure that [includes servers, networking, data centers, hypervisor layer, and even virtualization](https://www.theseattledataguy.com/5-aws-technologies-thatll-make-your-life-easier/).

Typically, this service also includes management of infrastructure as well as storage resiliency. Through IaaS, companies can install OS, deploy their [databases](https://www.theseattledataguy.com/big-data-bigger-results-data-driven-solutions-for-company/) and have the flexibility to constantly change the amount of storage, or environments they’re using. You can use pay monthly, hourly, or weekly — whichever is convenient for you.

IaaS is one of the fundamental service delivery methods in [cloud computing](https://logitanalytics.com/what-are-the-different-kinds-of-cloud-computing-services/). It allows companies to access storage, network, servers and much more, over the internet, via third-party cloud computing service providers. IaaS allows organizations to create an IT environment that meets their business requirements.

##### Real-life use cases

Some of the most popular IaaS examples include products likes AWS’s EC2 or RDS. These services allow you to easily spin up a Linux server or a database and scale it to your needs. No need to get a new server, just click create on AWS. There are also AWS workspaces which allow companies to spin up virtual PCs on a virtual private cloud network. This makes it easier to manage security and do remote work.

##### No need to buy a computer

Startups and small companies work with IaaS specifically to avoid spending more on hardware and software. They require scalability of IaaS and service providers like Google are great for it! You can actually keep exchanging day-to-day documentation on one central sheet via a simple link.

#### SaaS — what is it?

SaaS, or Software-as-a-Service, is a software distribution model that hosts applications online and makes them available for consumers. All you need is an internet connection and a web browser to use these apps.

The biggest benefit of SaaS is that it offers a web delivery model that completely eliminates the need to have an IT staff to install or download applications on every computer. For example, I use Google Docs a lot which not only helps me greatly by offering online storage but is accessible anywhere, on any device, with auto-saving options.

Besides, the vendor manages technical issues which makes app usage more convenient for SaaS users.

##### Real-life use cases

Some of the most popular SaaS providers include Google GSuite, Salesforce, Dropbox, and SAP Concur. The best example of SaaS is Gmail, an online email service, that allows you to access the files and applications hosted by Google from any device via the internet. The ability to use the product anywhere you have an internet connection without downloading software or using a product key allows employees to be productive anywhere.

#### PaaS — what is it?

PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud model that delivers software and hardware tools enabling consumers to develop, run, and test their applications. One of the biggest advantages of using PaaS is that it offers easy migration towards a hybrid model.

PaaS is similar to SaaS, however, instead of delivering software over the internet, it delivers a platform for creating software online. This makes building websites and apps much simpler.

Typically, PaaS delivers a framework for developers so they can create customized applications without having to worry about the infrastructure. PaaS works specifically for developers who can create the design and manage applications online. These applications tend to be highly scalable and always available.

##### Real-life use cases

Some of the most popular PaaS service providers include OpenShift, AWS Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Windows Azure. OpenShift, for instance, includes Linux OS, networking, registry, monitoring, authentication, and container runtime solutions so customers can use OpenShift to set up the infrastructure for their own enterprise developers.

#### FaaS — what is it?

FaaS, or Function-as-a-Service, is a category of cloud services that provides a platform for developers to run and manage the functionalities of their application without worrying about the infrastructure or complexity associated with the development of the app.

The biggest benefit of FaaS is that it offers serverless computing, letting developers deploy their production-ready code to the internet without the hassle of planning, provision, or maintenance of computing resources.

##### Real-life use cases

Most Popular examples of FaaS include Amazon Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. Lambda, for instance, executes the code only when it is needed, and scales the requests per day as per requirement automatically. Therefore, it comes in handy when combined with API Gateways to develop one optimal solution.

## Conclusion

Cloud computing can help a company scale up their IT solutions fast. It can offer a full-fledged platform that takes care of storage, servers, and virtual desktops. With cloud computing services such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS, your business can use virtualized infrastructure to manage its IT side.

Not only this, but the virtualization also makes it easier for companies to reduce costs and allow better analytics.

Cloud computing is all about simplifying technological processes. If your organization hasn’t taken up the services yet, you better begin the research to stay relevant in the market.
