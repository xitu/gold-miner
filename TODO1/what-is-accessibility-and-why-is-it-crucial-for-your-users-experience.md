# What is accessibility and why is it crucial for your user’s experience?

We are all different. We may have different gender, age, culture, health conditions. But probably we use many common products. So what makes them usable for so many different people? Accessibility.

Let’s see what accessibility stands for. 
Following Wikipedia, “accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities.” 
What kind of pictures appeared in your mind when you read the word “disabilities”? Was it a man in a wheelchair? Or maybe a deaf woman? Or a blind child?
These are probably the most common understandings of disabilities. But are they showing the spectrum of the problem?

In fact, disability literally means that the person is not able to do something using their senses, body or mind for some reason. And there are plenty of possible reasons.
World Health Organization says that disability is context depended. It means that “Disability is not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.” In other words, each situation that you are in defines your ability to achieve your goal. When the person has a broken arm she will not be able to use their smartphone using both hands. But the same experience would get the person on a crowded bus while holding a handrail. And if someone is in the loud restaurant he will not be able to hear the video — he would need, for example, the closed caption.

In Inclusive Design Toolkit, Microsoft called it the persona spectrum. It reveals the range of users’ disabilities depending on the context. Following the toolkit — users can have either permanent, temporary or situational disabilities. This knowledge can help you analyze your product in terms of not obvious use cases. If your product meets a deaf person’s needs, the person with an ear infection or who stays in a loud restaurant will benefit from it as well.

When you solve the accessibility problem for one group, you actually extend the value of it to many other people who will use your solution in temporary or situational circumstances. Thanks to that you can include as many people as possible in a similar experience of similar quality and value.

If you want to comprehensively evaluate your product in terms of accessibility, get familiar with WCAG standards. This guideline created by W3C organization provides complex recommendations for creating web and mobile products, so as many people as possible can use it in any circumstances. And remember, when you cover the accessibility problems for the group of permanently disabled people, a lot more people will benefit from it.
