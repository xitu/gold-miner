# The evolution of the Design — from UX towards personal experience

> Fine lines between designing product (UX), service (SD), customer experience (CX), Experience and Transformation

The emergence of design between 1750 and 1900 results from the important factors: its link with the industry — the role of the design reform movement (Arts & Crafts Movement) and the development of a modern machine style (Sparke, 2009 after Monika Rosińska, unpublished materials).

Design is a modern phenomenon born of the radically new ways in which manufacturing was organized in the second half of the eighteenth century. It had started in Great Britain and spreaded to continental Europe and North America. The Industrial Revolution has changed virtually every aspect of life: working and living conditions, urbanization, the emerging middle class and the role of woman. Design was provincial, retreating into interior design, product development and advertising (Holert, 2008). At that time design broke down the holistic craft process into its component elements and composed them in logical sequence of activities: designing, tooling, making, individual components and assembling them. The whole process was a highly planned. This was the fundamental transformation from craft manufacturing to a factory. The transformation shifted the way people bought and sold goods. These were the foundations of a modern design process that we are still familiar with (after Monika Rosińska, unpublished materials).

In 1824 Sir Robert Peel founded the National Gallery in order to restore the sense of design in the manufacturer and wake taste in consumers”. It was one of the acts of the nineteenth-century debate about taste. A group of architects was highly critical of the designed goods that flowed from the newly constructed factories, however, mass design was a stronger movement.

During the 1960s more critical voices of consumerism appeared, and one of them was Victor Papanek. Papanek was an industrial designer and most influential pioneer of an ecologically and socially oriented approach. He was against unsafe, nonfunctional and showy manufactured products. He noticed that design does not respond to real problems of users, only adopts the designer’s assumptions (Papanek, 1985).

The design of early twentieth-century was fully formed. The definition of design has evolved and finally was presented as an activity that link production and consumption, but autonomous towards them. Without a doubt, the world of design has changed the appearance of the Internet and digital technology. [As Agnieszka Szóstek — the Experience Designer — rightly points out (2018)](https://uxdesign.cc/where-is-the-difference-between-ux-cx-and-service-design-8ce0b8654a43), design is evolving together with the economy and the changing conditions of our times. The design goes alongside the Progression of Economic Value (Figure 2.).

The industrial era has brought new design branches related mainly to the development of digital objects like websites and apps. One of them was User Experience Design (UX) which focused on the product. However, the product itself, which was useful and usable, did not fully meet the expectations of customers. They hoped that they would be get end-to-end service — that the creator will make sure that the entire experience associated with the use of the product is pleasant (as customer service, delivery). This is how another design branches have grew — Service Design (SD) and Customer Experience (CX). Service Design aimed more on on the digital world and CX focused on physical domain (e.g. customer support). Experience design is now the next stage of development and encourages more than a product or service. It focuses on emotions and customer engagement.

The next step in the development of designing will be a transformational approach that will be largely focused on meaning rather than ends. Agnieszka Szóstek (2018) refers in her article to Means-End Theory, which explains the difference in previous design approaches (Figure 3). According to this theory, when customers use a product or service, they themselves value the recognition of their personal value (Souza Leão, Benício de Mello, 2007). In other words, customers translate product or service features and outputs of use into their self-relevant meaning. This model emphasis strongly the consequences for the customer, mainly psychological.

Few companies follow transformational approach and can apply it into every day operations. If any of them already operate at this level, it indicates their high level of maturity.
