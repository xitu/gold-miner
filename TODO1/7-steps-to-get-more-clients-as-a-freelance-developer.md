# How to get more clients as a freelance developer

## Practical tips I wish I knew a few years ago

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*GjnIq3MYSQy3GP_nsCSFxA.jpeg)

Whenever a conversation about freelancing kicks off with fellow developer friends, we‚Äôre always discussing the same concerns:

*   How can I get more clients as a freelance developer?
*   I finished a coding bootcamp and I want to get started as a freelancer. How can I start?
*   How do you deal with cheap competition?
*   How much should I charge?

### ‚ÄúHow do I get more clients?‚Äù

When I got started as a freelancer a few years ago, I made a lot of mistakes when trying to get more clients.

I thought of it like slices of pizza. Charging less (cutting smaller slices), would yield more projects (more slices). Right?

I also thought that I need to explicitly tell people that I‚Äôm a freelancer and post about it on Social media, or else, how will they ever find me?

I made these mistakes for a few years until I finally realized something.

#### Charging low gives a cheap impression to clients

This also drives them to ask me to do more work for the same price. I also realized that you immediately lose your value if you sell yourself directly.

Soon after I realized that I was doing it wrong, I was able to get high quality projects with higher budgets and better working conditions. The amount of effort I was putting in was minimal compared to before.

In the year that followed, my career started to pick up significantly. I started speaking at conferences around the world, presenting workshops for companies and banks and teaching online courses. Later, I became a [Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/jad-joubran).

Now that we got those misconceptions out of the way. Here‚Äôs some good news:

**You don‚Äôt need 10 years of experience to get more clients. ‚ö°Ô∏è**

It‚Äôs not about the years of experience, it‚Äôs about the service that you‚Äôre offering. It‚Äôs about the whole experience, from the time your client needs the service, all the way until the end.

Here are 7 steps that will help you get there and get you more clients.

### 1. Define who you are üë®‚Äçüé®

Before you start getting more clients, first you need to define how you want to appear to others‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat‚Äôs your image? How do you want people to see you?

If potential clients hear about you, they often need to know **who you are**. The first thing they would do is simply Google your name.

Try this: Open a new incognito tab and Google your full name. What is your first impression of yourself? Is is aligned with who you are and what you do?

**You can influence what people think about you.**

If it‚Äôs not completely aligned, the best way to change that image is to create a personal website where you show who you are and what you‚Äôre good at. Explain what you do in the first 2 seconds of them landing on your website.

This will motivate your visitors to scroll further down where you will prove to them that you‚Äôve got the experience you claim. More on this in a bit.

### 2. Don‚Äôt just be a developer ‚ö°Ô∏è

When you‚Äôre working on technical projects, it‚Äôs easy to get carried away and focus on the little technical details and forget about the big picture.

But if you focus only on the task you‚Äôre asked to do, then you‚Äôre going to be producing _average_ results. **What you need to focus on is _quality_ work**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*V0UjgCuX9HzTGK6nbAXQIQ.jpeg)

For you to focus on quality, you have to work on skills that are around your area of expertise. For example, if you‚Äôre a front-end developer, you should definitely know the basics of User Experience and Performance. This will help you deliver outstanding results.

The same applies to soft skills that can help your relationship with clients. For example, communication skills or business strategy. **Understanding the business behind the project will often transform you from a freelancer into a consultant.**

These skills will prove that you‚Äôre not just a developer, you‚Äôre a professional driven by quality. That‚Äôs what can make you stand out.

### 3. Show ‚Äôem, don‚Äôt tell ‚Äôem üëÄ

So how do you prove to people that you are who you claim to be? It‚Äôs not enough to say you‚Äôre good at what you do. You need to prove to them that you truly are experienced in that skill.

You just have to show them what you‚Äôve done. If you have previous projects to show, then that‚Äôs easy, you just display the ones you‚Äôre most proud of. But in some other cases (like when you have confidential projects), it might be tricky. This is a great opportunity to show your value without actually saying it.

Here‚Äôs an example: when you go to [my website](https://jadjoubran.io), I‚Äôm claiming to be a tech speaker and web consultant.

How do you know this is legit? You can see a background video of me giving talks in many settings (workshops, conferences). From this, visitors immediately lose any doubt and are convinced that I‚Äôm a tech speaker indeed.

Explain what you do above the fold

It doesn‚Äôt have to be a video. You can prove your value in many different ways, like displaying logos of companies you‚Äôve worked with, and showing blog articles you‚Äôve written.

### 4. Use indirect promotion üéØ

When you think about how to get more clients, a lot of people might think: ok, how about I start by posting on social media that I‚Äôm looking for freelance work?

I‚Äôve seen countless posts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter & Slack of developers and designers announcing to the whole world that they are looking for freelance opportunities.

It turns out, that‚Äôs exactly what you shouldn‚Äôt do. You immediately lose your value when you sell yourself directly.

Look at it this way. Remember how you felt when someone **called you** on the phone to sell you a certain service? How spammy was that? Wouldn‚Äôt you most likely ignore and hang up as soon as possible?

**One of the greatest tricks that I‚Äôve learned when it comes to getting clients is to never approach clients.**

It sounds contadictory, but it‚Äôs true. Instead, you apply the concept of indirect promotion.

How? Simply share on your social networks the activities and projects that you‚Äôre working on without mentioning the fact that you‚Äôre looking for clients. After you share your activities a few times, people will start to know you for what you do and they‚Äôll immediately recommend you for their friends and relatives whenever there‚Äôs an opportunity.

That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve gotten 100% of all my projects in the last 6 years. It works!

If you‚Äôve never had a freelance project before, then build a sample project instead of going and looking for work. Make it look very appealing.

Here‚Äôs an example of a tweet I posted.

### 5. Don‚Äôt aim for a steady stream of projects ‚è≥

You might think that being a successful freelancer means having a steady stream of projects and being 100% occupied with freelance work.

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way, and in fact, it shouldn‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôre occupied with freelance work all the time, then you‚Äôre not leaving time for you to be creative, learn new things, and work on your personal presence.

**I leave 50% of my time for personal research.** During that time, I watch online conferences, read technical articles, and try out the latest technologies.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LG1PJ4OxCjvE4noc24iydA.jpeg)

People often ask me, how did you learn XYZ.. and the answer is always the same: I built a sample app for it.

So it‚Äôs really important that you don‚Äôt keep on looking for freelance projects all the time, but take the time to learn new technologies which will in fact get you better projects and new opportunities over time.

### 6. Come up with your own process üîñ

It‚Äôs hard for us freelancers to be organized, since we‚Äôve got plenty of responsibilities on our plate. To make sure you have a smooth workflow with each client, create a process that you can follow for most of your projects.

This way, you‚Äôll have a plan ready to be launched whenever a potential project comes up. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the little things.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2elFS_hJ1y47D8sXpO_tNw.jpeg)

Here‚Äôs an example of my project kickoff workflow:

1.  Send proposal PDF
2.  Send contract
3.  Sign and receive counter-signed contract
4.  Send downpayment invoice
5.  Receive downpayment
6.  Carry out freelance task
7.  Send final invoice
8.  Send feedback form

When you have a personalized workflow, you will be comfortable working which will make your clients enjoy working with you and trust you. They will most likely refer you to other companies in the future.

### 7. Charge higher üí∞

If you‚Äôre just getting started, it‚Äôs okay to charge cheap for the first project or two, but after that you have to start charging higher.

You might think you don‚Äôt deserve to charge higher yet, but going through these steps will let you charge higher, because you have value that‚Äôs worth charging more for.

You may not know this, but **charging low makes your client feel that they‚Äôre getting low quality results.**

If you already have a lot of freelance work because you‚Äôre charging cheap, it‚Äôs more likely that charging higher will make you lose some clients. But that‚Äôs actually a good thing, as you‚Äôll end up earning a bit more while having more free time for research. It‚Äôs a risk that you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to take as it‚Äôs totally worth it.

Also, you won‚Äôt be working with over-demanding clients, you‚Äôll be working with clients that will appreciate your services.

When coming up with a price, you have to be comfortable charging that price‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand then increase it by 10 to 25%.

Let‚Äôs say for example you‚Äôre already working on a certain project for an hourly rate of ‚Ç¨80/hour. Since you dedicated a few hours of your time over the past few months to learn more about User Experience & Web Performance, you should now increase your hourly rate by around 15% as you‚Äôre bringing more value to the project.

Following these steps completely changed my life and I hope it will change yours too.

I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of experimentation with new technologies. Don‚Äôt wait for opportunities to knock on your door. Create those opportunities instead.

These were just a few tips from my free email course [Become an expert developer](https://learn.jadjoubran.io/). If you like these tips, then you will definitely love the course as we go in more details on how to grow in your expertise, get more quality clients, and more.
