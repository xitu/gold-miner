# Writing a Microservice in Rust

Let me begin this article on *Writing a Microservice in Rust* by talking about C++. I’ve been a reasonably active member of the C++ community for quite a while now, attending and [contributing talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6i8jmiy8MY) to conferences, following the development and evangelism of the language’s more modern features and of course writing lots of it. C++ is a language that gives its users very fine-grained control over all aspects of the program they are writing, at the cost of a steep learning curve and a [large body of knowledge](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4659.pdf) required to write effective C++. However, C++ is also a very old language, conceived by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, and thus caries a lot of technical debt even into modern standards. Of course, research into language design continued after the creation of C++, leading to interesting new programming languages like [Go](https://golang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) and many more. However, it’s very rare for one of these new languages to have significantly more interesting features than modern C++, *while still* guaranteeing the same performance and control over memory and hardware. Go set out to be a replacement for C++, but as [Rob Pike found himself](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html), C++ programmers were not quite elated by a language that offers less control at lower performance. On the other hand, Rust is appealing to many a C++ aficionado. Rust and C++ share quite a few design goals, such as *zero-cost abstractions* and detailed control over memory. However, on top of that, Rust adds a number of language features that make programs safer and more expressive, and development more productive. The things that excite me the most about Rust are

* The *borrow checker*, which greatly improves memory safety (`SEGFAULT`s no more!),
* Immutability (`const`) by default,
* Intuitive syntactic sugar such as pattern matching,
* No built-in implicit conversions between (arithmetic) types.

Now, having rambled, the remainder of this post will walk you through creating a small but complete *microservice* – similar to the [URL shortener](https://github.com/goldsborough/psag.cc) I built for my blog. With *microservice*, I mean an application that speaks HTTP, accepts requests, speaks to a database, returns a response (possibly serving HTML), packaged up in a Docker container and ready to be dropped somewhere in the cloud. For this post, we’ll build a simple chat application which lets you store and retrieve messages. I will introduce the relevant packages (crates) we’ll use for this as we go along. You can find the complete service [on GitHub](http://github.com/goldsborough/microservice-rs).

## Speaking HTTP

The first thing we need to teach our web service is how to *speak HTTP*. With that, I mean that our application (server) has to accept and parse HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. While there exist a number of high-level, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) like frameworks that abstract away most of the fun about this, we will opt for using the slightly lower-level [hyper](https://hyper.rs) library to handle HTTP, which uses the [tokio](https://tokio.rs) networking library and [futures](https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs), to give us the ability to create a neat asynchronous web server. For vanity, we’ll also use the [log](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.1/log/) and [env-logger](https://docs.rs/crate/env_logger/0.5.2) crates for logging purposes.

We’ll begin by setting up our `Cargo.toml` and grabbing said crates:

```plain
  [package]
  name = "microservice_rs"
  version = "0.1.0"
  authors = ["you <you@email>"]
  [dependencies]
  env_logger = "0.5.3"
  futures = "0.1.17"
  hyper = "0.11.13"
  log = "0.4.1"
```

Now to the actual code. Hyper has the concept of a `Service`, which is a type that implements the `Service` trait and has a `call` function, which can be called with a `hyper::Request` object representing a parsed HTTP request. That function must, for an asynchronous service, return a `Future`. Here is the basic boilerplate for this, which we can drop into our `main.rs`:

```rust
  extern crate hyper;
  extern crate futures;

  #[macro_use]
  extern crate log;
  extern crate env_logger;

  use hyper::server::{Request, Response, Service};

  use futures::future::Future;

  struct Microservice;

  impl Service for Microservice {
    type Request = Request;
    type Response = Response;
    type Error = hyper::Error;
    type Future = Box<Future<Item = Self::Response, Error = Self::Error>>;

    fn call(&self, request: Request) -> Self::Future {
      info!("Microservice received a request: {:?}", request);
      Box::new(futures::future::ok(Response::new()))
    }
  }
```

Note how we also have to declare some basic types for our service. Our future type is boxed, since `futures::future::Future` itself is only a trait and can thus not be returned from a function by value. Inside `call()`, we currently return the simplest valid value, a boxed future containing an empty response.

To start the server, we bind an IP address to a `hyper::server::Http` instance and call its `run()` method:

```rust
  fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let address = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse().unwrap();
    let server = hyper::server::Http::new()
      .bind(&address, || Ok(Microservice {}))
      .unwrap();
    info!("Running microservice at {}", address);
    server.run().unwrap();
  }
```

With the above code, hyper will start listening for HTTP requests at `localhost:8080`, parse incoming requests and forward them to our `Microservice` class. Note that a new instance is created for each new request. We are now ready to start our server and curl some requests at it! Start a server in one terminal:

```plain
  $ RUST_LOG="microservice=debug" cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
      Running `target/debug/microservice`
  INFO 2018-01-21T23:35:05Z: microservice: Running microservice at 127.0.0.1:8080
```

And send it requests from another:

```bash
  $ curl 'localhost:8080'
```

In the first terminal, you should see something like

```bash
  $ RUST_LOG="microservice=debug" cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
    Running `target/debug/microservice`
  Running microservice at 127.0.0.1:8080
  INFO 2018-01-21T23:35:05Z: microservice: Running microservice at 127.0.0.1:8080
  INFO 2018-01-21T23:35:06Z: microservice: Microservice received a request: Request { method: Get, uri: "/", version: Http11, remote_addr: Some(V4(127.0.0.1:61667)), headers: {"Host": "localhost:8080", "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0", "Accept": "*/*"} }
```

Hooray! We have ourselves a basic server, written in Rust. Note that in the commands above, I prepended `RUST_LOG="microservice=debug"` to `cargo run`. This is how we control the behavior of `env_logger`, which will look for this environment variable specifically. The first part of this specifies the root module for which we want to enable logging, and the second part (after the `=`) specifies the minimum logging level that will be visible. By default, only `error!` gets logged.

Now, let’s make our server actually do something. Since we’re building a chat application, the two kinds of requests we’ll want to handle are `POST` requests, with form data containing the user’s name and the message, and `GET` requests with optional `before` and `after` parameters to filter by time.

### Accepting `POST` Requests

Let’s begin on the write-side. We’ll accept `POST` requests to our service’s root path (`"/"`) and expect them to contain a `username` and `message` field in their form data. We’ll then pass that information on to a function that writes the values of those fields into a database. Finally, we return a response.

Let’s begin with rewriting `call()`:

```rust
  fn call(&self, request: Request) -> Self::Future {
        match (request.method(), request.path()) {
          (&Post, "/") => {
            let future = request
              .body()
              .concat2()
              .and_then(parse_form)
              .and_then(write_to_db)
              .then(make_post_response);
            Box::new(future)
          }
          _ => Box::new(futures::future::ok(
            Response::new().with_status(StatusCode::NotFound),
          )),
        }
      }
```

We distinguish between different requests by matching on the method and path of the request. The method will be `Post` or `Get` in our case. The only valid path for our service is the root path `"/"`. If the method is `&Post` and the path correct, we call the functions I mentioned earlier. Notice how beautifully we can pipeline the futures using their combination functions. The `and_then` combinator will call a function with the value contained in a future, if that future resolved successfully (did not contain an error). The function called must then return a new future. This allows passing values through several stages of processing, without computing anything *just yet*. Finally, we have a `then` combinator, which executes its callback regardless of the future’s state. As such, it receives a `Result` and not a value directly.

Here are the stubs for the functions used above:

```rust
  struct NewMessage {
    username: String,
    message: String,
  }

  fn parse_form(form_chunk: Chunk) -> FutureResult<NewMessage, hyper::Error> {
    futures::future::ok(NewMessage {
      username: String::new(),
      message: String::new(),
    })
  }

  fn write_to_db(entry: NewMessage) -> FutureResult<i64, hyper::Error> {
    futures::future::ok(0)
  }

  fn make_post_response(
    result: Result<i64, hyper::Error>,
  ) -> FutureResult<hyper::Response, hyper::Error> {
    futures::future::ok(Response::new().with_status(StatusCode::NotFound))
  }
```

and our `use` statements have changed a little too:

```rust
  use hyper::{Chunk, StatusCode};
  use hyper::Method::{Get, Post};
  use hyper::server::{Request, Response, Service};

  use futures::Stream;
  use futures::future::{Future, FutureResult};
```

Let’s continue by taking a look at `parse_form`, which receives a `Chunk` (a message body), and parses out the username and message while handling errors appropriately. To parse the form, we use the `url` crate (which you’ll have to grab with cargo):

```rust
  use std::collections::HashMap;
  use std::io;

  fn parse_form(form_chunk: Chunk) -> FutureResult<NewMessage, hyper::Error> {
    let mut form = url::form_urlencoded::parse(form_chunk.as_ref())
      .into_owned()
      .collect::<HashMap<String, String>>();

    if let Some(message) = form.remove("message") {
      let username = form.remove("username").unwrap_or(String::from("anonymous"));
      futures::future::ok(NewMessage {
        username: username,
        message: message,
      })
    } else {
      futures::future::err(hyper::Error::from(io::Error::new(
          io::ErrorKind::InvalidInput,
          "Missing field 'message",
      )))
    }
  }
```

After parsing the form into a hashmap, we attempt to remove the `message` key from it. If that fails, we return an error, since a message is mandatory. Otherwise, we grab the `username` field, which we default to `"anonymous"` if it’s not there. Finally, we return a successful future containing our simple `NewMessage` struct.

I’ll not talk about the `write_to_db` function just yet. Database interaction is a beast of its own, so I’ll devote a subsequent section to this function and the corresponding routine that reads messages from the database. However, note that `write_to_db` returns an `i64` when successful. This will be the timestamp of the submission of the new message into the database.

Instead, let’s see what we need to do to return a response back to whoever blessed our microservice with a request:

```rust
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate serde_json;

  fn make_post_response(
    result: Result<i64, hyper::Error>,
  ) -> FutureResult<hyper::Response, hyper::Error> {
    match result {
      Ok(timestamp) => {
        let payload = json!({"timestamp": timestamp}).to_string();
        let response = Response::new()
          .with_header(ContentLength(payload.len() as u64))
          .with_header(ContentType::json())
          .with_body(payload);
        debug!("{:?}", response);
        futures::future::ok(response)
      }
      Err(error) => make_error_response(error.description()),
    }
  }
```

We match on the `result` to see if we were able to write to the database successfully or not. If so, we’ll create a JSON payload forming the body of the response we return. For this I use the `serde_json` crate, which you should add to your `Cargo.toml`. When constructing the response struct, we need to set the correct HTTP headers. In this case, this means setting the `Content-Length` header to the length of the response body and the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.

I’ve refactored out the code to make the response struct for the erroneous case into a separate function `make_error_response`, since we’ll be re-using that later on:

```rust
  fn make_error_response(error_message: &str) -> FutureResult<hyper::Response, hyper::Error> {
    let payload = json!({"error": error_message}).to_string();
    let response = Response::new()
      .with_status(StatusCode::InternalServerError)
      .with_header(ContentLength(payload.len() as u64))
      .with_header(ContentType::json())
      .with_body(payload);
    debug!("{:?}", response);
    futures::future::ok(response)
  }
```

The response construction is quite similar to the previous function, however this time we have to set the HTTP status of the response to `StatusCode::InternalServerError` (status 500). The default is OK (200), so we didn’t have to set the status earlier.

### Accepting `GET` Requests

Next, let’s move on to `GET` requests, which will be sent to our server to fetch messages. The request is allowed to have two query arguments, `before` and `after`, both timestamps to constrain the messages fetched according to their timestamp, and both optional. If neither `before` nor `after` are present, we will return only the last message.

Below is the code for the match arm handling `GET` requests. It’s slightly more logic than before:

```rust
  (&Get, "/") => {
    let time_range = match request.query() {
      Some(query) => parse_query(query),
      None => Ok(TimeRange {
        before: None,
        after: None,
      }),
    };
    let response = match time_range {
      Ok(time_range) => make_get_response(query_db(time_range)),
      Err(error) => make_error_response(&error),
    };
    Box::new(response)
  }
```

By calling `request.query()`, we get an `Option<&str>`, since a URI may not have a query string at all. If it is present, we call `parse_query`, which parses the query arguments and returns a `TimeRange` struct, defined as

```rust
  struct TimeRange {
    before: Option<i64>,
    after: Option<i64>,
  }
```

Since both `before` and `after` arguments are optional, we make both `Option`s in the `TimeRange` struct. Further, the timestamps may be invalid (e.g. not numeric), so we have to deal with the case where parsing their values fails. In such a case, `parse_query` will return an error message, which we can forward to the `make_error_response` function we wrote earlier. Otherwise, we can go on to call `query_db`, which will fetch the messages for us, and `make_get_response`, which creates an appropriate `Response` object to return back to the client.

To parse the query string, we again use the `url::form_urlencoded` function from earlier, since the syntax is still `key=value&key=value`. We then try to fetch the `before` and `after` values and convert them to integers (timestamps):

```rust
  fn parse_query(query: &str) -> Result<TimeRange, String> {
    let args = url::form_urlencoded::parse(&query.as_bytes())
      .into_owned()
      .collect::<HashMap<String, String>>();

    let before = args.get("before").map(|value| value.parse::<i64>());
    if let Some(ref result) = before {
      if let Err(ref error) = *result {
          return Err(format!("Error parsing 'before': {}", error));
      }
    }

    let after = args.get("after").map(|value| value.parse::<i64>());
    if let Some(ref result) = after {
      if let Err(ref error) = *result {
        return Err(format!("Error parsing 'after': {}", error));
      }
    }

    Ok(TimeRange {
      before: before.map(|b| b.unwrap()),
      after: after.map(|a| a.unwrap()),
    })
  }
```

The code for this is unfortunately slightly clunky and repetitive, but is hard to make much nicer in this case without added complexity. Essentially, we try to get the `before` and `after` fields from the form, and if they are there, we attempt to parse them as `i64`. One thing I would have wished for here is to be able to combine multiple `if let` statements, so we could write:

```rust
  if let Some(ref result) = before && let Err(ref error) = *result {
    return Err(format!("Error parsing 'before': {}", error));
  }
```

However, this is not currently possible in Rust (you can have multiple values in `if let` statements by packing them in tuples, but not if the values depend on each other, like here).

Skipping over `query_db` for now, `make_get_response` looks fairly simple:

```rust
  fn make_get_response(
      messages: Option<Vec<Message>>,
  ) -> FutureResult<hyper::Response, hyper::Error> {
    let response = match messages {
      Some(messages) => {
        let body = render_page(messages);
        Response::new()
          .with_header(ContentLength(body.len() as u64))
          .with_body(body)
      }
      None => Response::new().with_status(StatusCode::InternalServerError),
    };
    debug!("{:?}", response);
    futures::future::ok(response)
  }
```

If the `messages` option contains a value, we can pass the messages on to `render_page`, which will return an HTML page that forms the body of our response, showing the messages in a simple HTML list. If the option is empty, an error occurred in `query_db`, which we’ll log but not expose to the user, so we just return a response with status code 500. I’ll cover the implementation of `render_page` in the section on templating.

## Connecting to a Database

Now that we have paths for both writing and reading in our service, we need to tie the ends together with a database to write to and read from. Rust has a very nice and popular object relational model (ORM) library called [diesel](http://diesel.rs), which is very fun and intuitive to work with. Add it to your `Cargo.toml` and enable the `postgres` feature, since we’ll be using [Postgres](https://postgresql.org) for this tutorial:

```plain
    diesel = { version = "1.0.0", features = ["postgres"] }
```

Please make sure you have Postgres installed on your machine and are able to log in with `psql` (as a basic sanity check). Diesel also supports other DBMSs like MySQL, in case you want to try those out after this tutorial.

Let’s begin by creating a database schema for our application. We’ll drop it in `schemas/messages.sql`:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT EXTRACT('epoch' FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  )
```

Each row in our table stores a message, represented by a monotonically incrementing ID, the username of the author, the message text and finally a timestamp. The default value of the timestamp specified above will insert the current seconds since the epoch for every new entry. Since the `id` column is also auto-incrementing, we’ll ultimately only have to insert the username and message for each new row.

We now have to integrate this table with Diesel. For this, you’ll need to install the Diesel CLI with `cargo install diesel_cli`. Then, you can run the following command:

```rust
  $ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@localhost
  $ diesel print-schema | tee src/schema.rs
  table! {
    messages (id) {
      id -> Int4,
      username -> Varchar,
      message -> Text,
      timestamp -> Int8,
    }
  }
```

where `<user>:<password>` are your database’s username and password. If your database doesn’t have a password, the user will suffice. The latter command shows us the representation of our database in Rust, which we also store in `src/schema.rs`. The `table!` macro comes from Diesel. Besides the *schema*, Diesel also requires us to write a *model*. This we have to write ourselves, in `src/models.rs`:

```rust
  #[derive(Queryable, Serialize, Debug)]
  pub struct Message {
    pub id: i32,
    pub username: String,
    pub message: String,
    pub timestamp: i64,
  }
```

This model is the Rust struct we interact with in our code. To do so, we need to add a few declarations to our main module:

```rust
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate serde_derive;
  #[macro_use]
  extern crate diesel;

  mod schema;
  mod models;
```

At this point, we are ready to fill in the functions `write_to_db` and `query_db` that we left out earlier.

### Writing to the Database

We’ll begin with `write_to_db`, which should simply write an entry into the database and return its creation timestamp:

```rust
  use diesel::prelude::*;
  use diesel::pg::PgConnection;

  fn write_to_db(
    new_message: NewMessage,
    db_connection: &PgConnection,
  ) -> FutureResult<i64, hyper::Error> {
    use schema::messages;
    let timestamp = diesel::insert_into(messages::table)
      .values(&new_message)
      .returning(messages::timestamp)
      .get_result(db_connection);

    match timestamp {
      Ok(timestamp) => futures::future::ok(timestamp),
      Err(error) => {
        error!("Error writing to database: {}", error.description());
        futures::future::err(hyper::Error::from(
            io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "service error"),
        ))
      }
    }
  }
```

And it’s as easy as that! Diesel exposes a very intuitive and type-safe query interface, with which we:

* specify the table we are inserting into,
* specify the value(s) we are inserting (more on this in a second),
* specify what values we want to return at the same (if any) and
* call `get_result`, which will actually execute the query.

This gives us a `QueryResult<i64>` object, which we can match on, handling errors as needed. Two things that should surprise you above are that (1) we can pass the `NewMessage` struct as-is to Diesel and (2) we are using a magical `db_connection` parameter that wasn’t there before. Let’s resolve these two mysteries! For (1), this will not actually compile with the code I have given you so far. To make it compile, we need to move our `NewMessage` struct into `src/models.rs`, right under the `Message` struct, and make it look like so:

```rust
  use schema::messages;

  #[derive(Queryable, Serialize, Debug)]
  pub struct Message {
    pub id: i32,
    pub username: String,
    pub message: String,
    pub timestamp: i64,
  }

  #[derive(Insertable, Debug)]
  #[table_name = "messages"]
  pub struct NewMessage {
    pub username: String,
    pub message: String,
  }
```

This way, Diesel can directly associate the fields of our struct with the columns in the database. Neat! Note that, for this, the table must be called `messages`, as indicated by the `table_name` attribute.

For the second mystery, we’ll have to change our code a bit to introduce the concept of a database connection. In `Service::call()`, put the following right at the top:

```rust
  fn call(&self, request: Request) -> Self::Future {
    let db_connection = match connect_to_db() {
      Some(connection) => connection,
      None => {
        return Box::new(futures::future::ok(
          Response::new().with_status(StatusCode::InternalServerError),
        ))
      }
    };
```

where `connect_to_db` is defined as

```rust
  use std::env;

  const DEFAULT_DATABASE_URL: &'static str = "postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432";

  fn connect_to_db() -> Option<PgConnection> {
    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").unwrap_or(String::from(DEFAULT_DATABASE_URL));
    match PgConnection::establish(&database_url) {
      Ok(connection) => Some(connection),
      Err(error) => {
        error!("Error connecting to database: {}", error.description());
        None
      }
    }
  }
```

This function looks for the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` to determine the Postgres database URL, or uses a pre-defined constant otherwise. It then attempts to create a new database connection and returns it if possible. You’ll also want to update your `GET` and `POST` handlers:

```rust
  (&Post, "/") => {
    let future = request
      .body()
      .concat2()
      .and_then(parse_form)
      .and_then(move |new_message| write_to_db(new_message, &db_connection))
      .then(make_post_response);
    Box::new(future)
  }
  (&Get, "/") => {
    let time_range = match request.query() {
      Some(query) => parse_query(query),
      None => Ok(TimeRange {
        before: None,
        after: None,
      }),
    };
    let response = match time_range {
      Ok(time_range) => make_get_response(query_db(time_range, &db_connection)),
      Err(error) => make_error_response(&error),
    };
    Box::new(response)
  }
```

With this scheme, we’ll be creating a new Database connection for each request. Depending on your setup, this may be fine. However, you may also want to consider using [r2d2](https://github.com/diesel-rs/r2d2-diesel) to establish a *connection pool* which will keep a constant number of connections open for you and hand you one as you need it.

### Querying the Database

We can now write new messages into the database – that’s awesome. Next, we’ll want to figure out how to read them back out by querying the database appropriately. Let’s implement `query_db`:

```rust
  fn query_db(time_range: TimeRange, db_connection: &PgConnection) -> Option<Vec<Message>> {
    use schema::messages;
    let TimeRange { before, after } = time_range;
    let query_result = match (before, after) {
      (Some(before), Some(after)) => {
        messages::table
          .filter(messages::timestamp.lt(before as i64))
          .filter(messages::timestamp.gt(after as i64))
          .load::<Message>(db_connection)
      }
      (Some(before), _) => {
        messages::table
          .filter(messages::timestamp.lt(before as i64))
          .load::<Message>(db_connection)
      }
      (_, Some(after)) => {
        messages::table
          .filter(messages::timestamp.gt(after as i64))
          .load::<Message>(db_connection)
      }
      _ => messages::table.load::<Message>(db_connection),
    };
    match query_result {
      Ok(result) => Some(result),
      Err(error) => {
        error!("Error querying DB: {}", error);
        None
      }
    }
  }
```

The code for this is unfortunately slightly complex. This is because both `before` and `after` are `Option`s, and Diesel does not currently provide an easy way to gradually build up a query. So we have to exhaustively check if `before` or `after` are `Some` or `None` and perform zero to two filters each time. The querying itself, however, is once more simple and intutitive. Since `where` is a keyword in Rust, the `WHERE` clause from SQL is implemented with the `filter` method in Diesel. Relational operators like `>` or `=` are methods on the model structs, like `.gt()` or `.eq()`.

## Rendering HTML Templates

We’re very close! All that’s left at this point is to write `render_page`, which we left out earlier. For this, we’ll want to use a *templating* library. Templating, in the context of web servers, is the general concept of creating an HTML page with dynamic data and control flow. Popular templating libraries in other languages are [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) in JavaScript or [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org) in Python. While I personally used a [Rust port of Handlebars](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) for my [url-shortening project](http://github.com/goldsborough/psag.cc), I have to say that the landscape of templating libraries in Rust is [not fantastic](http://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/templating/). Like in quite a few domains in Rust, there is no go-to, “quasi-standard” library like Jinja is in Python. This makes picking one of the hard, since you never know if it will turn into abandonware 6 months down the road.

Nevertheless, for this tutorial, we’ll use a templating library called [maud](http://maud.lambda.xyz). Albeit not be the most scalable option for a real-world application, maud is interesting and clever, allowing us to write HTML templates directly in Rust, using natural control flow. If anything, maud shows off the power of Rust macros. That said, maud will require a nightly build of Rust to enable the procedural macro feature, which is [close to being stable, it seems](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/38356).

First, add `maud` to your Cargo.toml:

```rust
  [dependencies]
  maud = "0.17.2"
```

Then, add the following declarations to the top of your `main.rs`:

```rust
  #![feature(proc_macro)]
  extern crate maud;
```

Now, we can write `render_page`:

```bash
  fn render_page(messages: Vec<Message>) -> String {
    (html! {
      head {
        title "microservice"
        style "body { font-family: monospace }"
      }
      body {
        ul {
          @for message in &messages {
            li {
              (message.username) " (" (message.timestamp) "): " (message.message)
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }).into_string()
  }
```

*mind = blown*? Yes, somewhat. Just let that sink in for a bit. Breathe in deeply. Exhale. You’re writing an HTML page using a Rust macro. Damn.

And that’s it! Our microservice is complete. And *micro* it is. Let’s run it:

```bash
  $ DATABASE_URL="postgresql://goldsborough@localhost" RUST_LOG="microservice=debug" cargo run
  Compiling microservice v0.1.0 (file:///Users/goldsborough/Documents/Rust/microservice)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 12.30 secs
    Running `target/debug/microservice`
  INFO 2018-01-22T01:22:16Z: microservice: Running microservice at 127.0.0.1:8080
```

and then in another terminal:

```bash
  $ curl -X POST -d 'username=peter&message=hi' 'localhost:8080'
  {"timestamp":1516584255}
  $ curl -X POST -d 'username=mike&message=hi2' 'localhost:8080'
  {"timestamp":1516584282}
```

In the first, you should see the debug logs:

```plain
    ...
    DEBUG 2018-01-22T01:24:14Z: microservice: Request { method: Post, uri: "/", version: Http11, remote_addr: Some(V4(127.0.0.1:64869)), headers: {"Host": "localhost:8080", "User-Agent": "curl/7.54.0", "Accept": "*/*", "Content-Length": "25", "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"} }
    DEBUG 2018-01-22T01:24:14Z: microservice: Response { status: Ok, version: Http11, headers: {"Content-Length": "24", "Content-Type": "application/json"} }
    ...
```

Now, let’s `GET` some messages:

```bash
  $ curl 'localhost:8080'
  <head><title>microservice</title><style>body { font-family: monospace }</style></head><body><ul><li>peter (1516584255): hi</li><li>mike (1516584282): hi2</li></ul></body>
```

or, if you navigate your web browser to `http://localhost:8080`:

You can also try adding `?after=<timestamp>&before=<timestamp>` to the query URL and verify that you only get messages in the specified time range.

## Packaging with Docker

I’ll talk very briefly about how to package this application in a Docker container. This doesn’t have anything to do with Rust per-se, but it’s useful to know about relevant Docker containers to base yours on.

There are two official Docker images maintained by the Rust developers: one for stable and one for nightly Rust. The stable Rust image is simply [`rust`](https://hub.docker.com/_/rust/) and the nightly one is [`rust-lang/rust:nightly`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rustlang/rust/). Basing our container on one of these is very simple. We’ll want to base ours on the nightly image. Make the content of your `Dockerfile` look like this:

```Dockerfile
    FROM rustlang/rust:nightly
    MAINTAINER <your@email>

    WORKDIR /var/www/microservice/
    COPY . .

    RUN rustc --version
    RUN cargo install

    CMD ["microservice"]
```

We’ll run the Postgres database in a separate Docker container, as is typical of a microservice architecture. Make this `Dockerfile-db`:

```Dockerfile
    FROM postgres
    MAINTAINER <your@email>

    # Create the table on start-up
    ADD schemas/messages.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
```

And tie things together with a [docker-compose.yaml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```yaml
  version: '2'
  services:
    server:
      build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile
      networks:
        - network
      ports:
          - "8080:80"
      environment:
        DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:secret@db:5432
        RUST_BACKTRACE: 1
        RUST_LOG: microservice=debug
    db:
      build:
        context: .
        dockerfile: docker/Dockerfile-db
      restart: always
      networks:
        - network
      environment:
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret

  networks:
    network:
```

This file is a bit more involved, but once it’s written, the rest is a breeze. Note that I place both Dockerfiles into a `docker/` folder. Now, simply run `docker-compose up`:

```bash
  $ docker-compose up
  Recreating microservice_db_1 ...
  Recreating microservice_server_1 ... done
  Attaching to microservice_db_1, microservice_server_1
  server_1  |  INFO 2018-01-22T01:38:57Z: microservice: Running microservice at 127.0.0.1:8080
  db_1      | 2018-01-22 01:38:57.886 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5432
  db_1      | 2018-01-22 01:38:57.886 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
  db_1      | 2018-01-22 01:38:57.891 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on Unix socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"
  db_1      | 2018-01-22 01:38:57.917 UTC [20] LOG:  database system was shut down at 2018-01-22 00:10:07 UTC
  db_1      | 2018-01-22 01:38:57.939 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

This will look different for you the first time you run it, of course. Anyway, that’s all there is to it. You could now push this into a GitHub repo, drop it on a (free) [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/free/) instance, and access your service from the outside world. Wooh!

## Epilogue

Pieced together, the above snippets of code make up around 270 lines necessary to create our full-fledged microservice in Rust. I’m not saying that’s little, compared to the equivalent code written in, say, Flask. However, there are also more batteries-inclued web frameworks available in Rust, such as [Rocket](https://rocket.rs), that abstract away even more for you. Nevertheless, I believe taking this route and going slightly lower level with *Hyper* gave you some nice insights into how you can leverage Rust to write a safe and performant webservice.

I wrote this blog post to share the knowledge I picked up while learning about Rust and applying my knowledge to a small [url-shortening webservice](http://github.com/goldsborough/psag.cc) that I use to shorten URLs for my blog (which, if you take a look at your browser’s URL bar, are quite long). Coming out of this, I feel like I now have a solid appreciation for the features Rust brings along, and where it is more expressive and safe or less expressive (but not less safe) to work with compared to modern C++.

I feel like it may take another few years for Rust’s ecosystem to stabilize and go-to, stable and well-maintained packages to establish themselves for the majority of tasks. Nevertheless, the prospects are promising. Facebook is already investigating the use of Rust for a new [Mercurial server](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/18/facebook_mercurial_devs_forget_git/) which would host its codebase. And more and more people are looking at Rust as an interesting option for embedded programming. I’ll be watching the development of the language closely, meaning I subscribed to the `r/Rust` subreddit.
