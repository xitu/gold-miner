# How to organize a Hacktoberfest-themed meetup

### Step-by-step

1.  Craft an event agenda.
2.  Set a date: Confirm that your preferred venue and any co-organizers, speakers, and facilitators are available.
3.  Promote the event: Invite your community to attend. And don't forget to add your event [here](http://do.co/hacktoberfest18event)!
4.  Facilitate the event: Create an open, inclusive, and welcoming atmosphere.
5.  Share special moments on social media. (Please remember to ask attendees permission to use their photos.)

### Who to invite to the meetup

Anyone interested in learning about and/or contributing to open source.

### When's the best time to host your meetup?

Preferably the first half of October to give participants time to complete five PRs!

### Where to host your event

An easily accessible, inclusive location with reliable WiFi and a comfortable space that is workshop and live-coding friendly, for example:

*   Classroom at a university or code school
*   Coworking space
*   Incubator/accelerator
*   Office of an open source/tech company
*   Anywhere that will have you!

### Sample agenda

This is merely a suggestion — feel free to customize it to suit your community!

*   **Welcome** Set a welcoming, open, and inclusive tone. Thank everyone for attending, tell them about yourself, and give an overview of the programming of the day/evening, and remind them of the code of conduct.
    
*   **Intro to Hacktoberfest: the celebration, prizes, and instructions** It's important to mention the key points of Hacktoberfest, for example: "This is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem, for beginners and veterans alike." See Intro to Hacktoberfest for details.
    
*   **Intro to open source** See [Resources](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#resources) section for inspiration.
    
*   **Workshop: how to contribute to open source** See [Resources](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#resources) section for inspiration.
    
*   **Demos [optional; before/after hack time]** 3–5 minute demos by anyone interested in sharing their open source projects.
    
*   **Hack time** Hacking together: facilitate the formation of groups by interest/[insert your community's preferred format].
    

### Speakers & facilitators

You and your co-organizers are encouraged to facilitate the workshops! (You got it!) If you’d like extra help, invite open source project owners/maintainers, leaders passionate about open source, and computer science educators who support open source in your community to come speak or help with meetup attendees. If there is an experienced open source enthusiast in your community, reach out to them via email or on Twitter! The worst that can happen is they’re not able to attend :)

### Photo sharing

Encourage event participants to share photos on social media using the hashtag #hacktoberfest. (Please be mindful of photo preferences of attendees — don’t force camera shy individuals into photos!)

### Food & drinks

Something delicious that your community will enjoy! Bonus: one or two items that add a festive [fall/autumn](https://www.pinterest.com/explore/fall-party-foods/) or [Oktoberfest](https://www.pinterest.com/explore/oktoberfest-party/) mood. Remember to account for food allergies, preferences, and local alcohol consumption laws (if alcohol is served).

### Other fun ideas

*   First pull request of the evening to receive [insert prize].
*   Raffle off 3–5 prizes to be given away at the end of the evening.
*   Wrap up the event by inviting participants to share what they learned/worked on.

### Event code of conduct

Hacktoberfest events are welcoming, open, and inclusive. Include this line on your event page: "Please read our [Events Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFKOhyUqMZzrZcbq8A_TpO5x9J9HK6agv70awCH8pyI/edit?usp=sharing) before attending. Happy hacking!"

## Promoting your event

1.  Share the event via email, social networks, and/or printed flyers. Consider posting on channels popular with developers and open source enthusiasts in your area, including but not limited to:

**What's Hacktoberfest?**

Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. No contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

Can't make it to this event? Hacktoberfest is virtual and open to participants from around the globe. [Sign up to participate today](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

**Rules and Prizes**

First sign up on the Hacktoberfest site. If you open up five pull requests between October 1 and October 31, you'll win a free, limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt. (Pull requests do not have to be merged and accepted; as long as they've been opened between the very start of October 1 and the very end of October 31, they count towards a free T-shirt.)

Connect with other Hacktoberfest participants (Hacktobefestants?) by using the hashtag, #hacktoberfest, on your social media platform of choice.

New to DigitalOcean? Receive USD $10 in infrastructure credit at [do.co/hacktoberfest2018](https://do.co/hacktoberfest2018).
