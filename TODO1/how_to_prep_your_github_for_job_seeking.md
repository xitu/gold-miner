# How to prep your GitHub for job seeking

Rightfully or not, technical recruiters tend to infer a lot of information about you from your GitHub profile; and since more and more recruiters are requesting to see it or find it with a simple google search. It is important for job-seeking developers to think about GitHub as an extension of their CV.

With that in mind, I've compiled a few pointers based on the "mistakes" I've seen in the GitHub accounts of the people I've interviewed those past weeks.

I focus mostly on developers because but most ideas can be generalized to any profiles.

> I migrated to GitLab because M$ sucks

Let's get that out of the way very quickly.

First of all professional adults don't speak like that (in public) so make sure you keep that opinion to yourself and not as I've seen once in the README.md of a pinned repository. Although my company doesn't use any Microsoft products at this time we will not close the door to choosing one on technical and financial merit and using it in the future. I don't need developers who will not be able to evaluate a technology with an open mind.

Gitlab looks like a fine alternative although since I use GitHub myself and I am reviewing 20 GitHub profiles for one on GitLab I am much more familiar with GitHub's interface. It doesn't mean you have to use it and most of the advice below should more or less translate. (If you're using bitbucket you have obviously never applied with us...)

### Groom your profile

First, let's look at the bare minimum you should do to your overall profile.

### Add your picture, a short bio, and a link to your others relevant websites

Having a completed profile gives the impression that you care about your GitHub and that you're an organized person. Yes, we have your CV and probably your LinkedIn but it's the worst of the three that will make the longest lasting impression.

**A real picture is better than a cartoon, manga or a symbol.**

If you are job seeking it's important that you look clean; avoid pictures you wouldn't normally send to an employer including, naked, drinking, ninja, hacker or terrorist disguise or any picture that gives the impression that you smell worse than you look.

On a GitHub profile you preferably want to look relaxed and friendly so avoid overly formal pictures but stay professional. In doubt aim for a "casual Friday" style.

Finally, your graduation toga portrait is not a good picture. Don't use it. It makes you look inexperienced.

**Use @ mention to link other repos the recruiter should notice.** to your company, group or other repositories you're participating in or managing.

Include the URL for your personal site. If you have one and it doesn't look like crap make sure that it is included. (hint: If it looks like crap, maybe you should not have that site in the first place...)

Link to your other relevant profiles. If you are active on other sites such as StackOverflow, CodePen, Behance, Dribble or whatever make sure that all your profiles are linked together. Do not link to your profile on furries, weeaboo and cosplay forums as it is not relevant to your professional experience.

> **A note about unexpected linking**
>
> Google is a great link generator so do not reuse the same nickname on all those different sites if you don't want your recruiter to find them because we will when we do a social media check.
>
> I can't tell you how many time I googled a GitHub's username and through association found by google, I discovered their side hustle which ranged from competing with their employer on Upwork to running illegal dog breeding operation and what looked like solicitation on Instagram.

### Select your pinned repositories for the recruiter.

If you're looking for a job the pinned repositories which appear at the top of your profile should not be shortcuts to your most frequently accessed repositories but a showcase for your most impressive ones. Maybe they are the same but most likely not.

As a recruiter, I don't care to see your bash_profile instead pin the repositories that you want to highlight to the recruiter. They should be relevant and show work that has been done, etc..

⚠️ Pin the top 3 repositories that you want the recruiter to review.

### Do not pin tutorials

Please realize that we can see a lot of CVs so if your repo is from a tutorial or a boot camp, there's a chance I've seen it three or thirty times already. Projects that are overly simple or projects in which 80% comes from the tutorial and you've filled in the blanks don't tell me much about your abilities or worse they tell me that's the pinnacle of what you can do. There's no problem in having them just don't highlight them.

If that's all you have, it's better not to pin anything and to call those repo what they are: tutorials. Do not try to pass them for your own invention and do not try to overplay them; they are tutorial for beginners they won't impress anyone and as I said before I probably already saw [that tutorial](https://github.com/search?q=pig+dom).

### Pin tech demos with relevant technologies...

*...before larger project with outdated tech.*

If, for example, you're on the market for an SPA developer job then pin Angular/React/Vue tech demos over that big Laravel + jQuery thing you were working on 3 years ago.

If you're like most people you're not running a successful open source project and most of your day to day production of code is the property of your employer so you might feel bad not having a super impressive project to showcase. Worry not. Most people don't.

Instead of failing to impress with an unfinished and mostly abandoned overambitious project (Who doesn't have 1 or... 10?) focus on some interesting small tech demos in your framework of choice. If you're already working professionally there is certainly a problem that you solved that would make for an interesting demo and you just need to rewrite it quickly or ask your current boss for authorization to publish it.

**If you're a beginner**, I suggest you work on some demos that demonstrate your understanding of CS theory even if it's bubble sort or tree walker visualization in React or Vue. You'll look like a freaking genius compared to your peers with a todo app from an Udemy tutorial.

*For inspiration:*

-   <https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html>

-   <https://visualgo.net/en>

If you have hobbies outside of CS (like music) do incorporate that instead. I don't know, make a [small synthesizer](https://github.com/JanCVanB/vue-synth/blob/master/src/components/Synth.vue) or something.

### Remove useless forks

I got a lot of submission with profiles containing hundreds of forked repositories with zero contributions. First, it makes it difficult to see what you're actually engaged with and second it gives the impression that you don't understand how Git (and GitHub) works and you're using forks as bookmarks.

Some people may be using forks to "pad" their profile with the mistaken impression that it will impress recruiters or their friend. It's not impressive and it makes you look like a bumbling idiot. Don't do it.

⚠️ Fork a repository only if you have made contributions otherwise use the star or follow.

### Clean up your starred repository

This will get many people angry but here goes anyway: Your starred repositories give an indication to a visitor of your interests and they should change with the maturity of your skills so what you've starred influences how you are perceived.

⚠️ You should review your last few pages of stars and remove the one that could be misinterpreted.

#### Beginner Vs Senior

Roughly speaking, people looking for a senior position should be starring repository containing complex projects and avoid too many beginners or tutorial repos (unless you're contributing).

Imagine reviewing a profile for a senior react developer and seeing that the last two repos she was interested in were [iliakan/javascript-tutorial-en](https://github.com/iliakan/javascript-tutorial-en) and [kay-is/react-from-zero](https://github.com/kay-is/react-from-zero) you may wonder if the candidate actually has the skills she pretends to have or if she's still at the tutorial level.

On the other hand, if you're clearly applying for a junior position or indicated that you're currently learning that technology then having starred those two repositories "make sense" within your story.

#### White Hat Vs Black Hat

I love security stuff, from a white hat perspective and I think it's a plus for any developer to feel concerned about it but do avoid having a long list obscure cracking tools starred unless you're applying for a security position. One person I reviewed the profile had a long list of wifi cracker and phishing tools followed by a bunch of share enumerator and finally a couple of password bruteforcing tools. As far as telling a story goes it wasn't the best one.

Etc..

### Groom your showcased repositories

So once you've selected a few repositories to showcase; make sure they are accessible. Here is the minimum they should have:

### All projects should have an interesting README

For the love of whatever matters to you please, please add a description to your projects. It sounds obvious but I cannot tell you how many time I've seen repos with no readme or the default readme created by whatever skeleton tool was used.

Here's the minimum you should have in your readme:

#### A description

You need to make it very easy for someone who has 60 seconds to understand what the hell this is about and why that makes you a good programmer.

Make sure you answer at least the following questions:

- **What does it do?** Write a short sentence and list the working functionalities.
- **What is it?** Clearly, indicate what that code is supposed to produce. Is it a web, desktop, mobile app or a library?
- **What technologies are used?** List all the important framework and libraries that contribute to this project. It's useful for a recruiter who is not necessarily familiar with every single framework on earth to know if this is Laravel and Vue or React and Expressjs.
- **What is the ambition of the project?** Are you just test-driving a technology or is it something that is or will go live somewhere?
- **What is the stage of the project?** Clearly, indicate where you are with it. Whether it is complete or a work in progress? If it's a work in progress indicate what is done and what is pending.
- **Are there some known issues or things that are not properly done?** If yes list them because I'll be much more tolerant when/if I find shortcomings that have been highlighted than if I just discover them myself.

#### Tell me what to look at

If you're insisting on showcasing a large project there is a probably a lot of boilerplate or "plumbing" that is absolutely uninteresting so do not hesitate to indicate where are the juiciest bits.

If it's a fork in which you're contributing, make clear what you've been working on and if it's too hard to pinpoint then don't showcase that project.

#### How to run it

You should absolutely have a clear and precise explanation of how to run it (or how to use it if it is a library).

Running a demo version of your project must one-liner activity such as `npm run`, `graddle serve`, `docker run` .. or whatever is used by your framework.

There's very little reason in this day and age to have a long list of manual dependencies and pre-setup to run anything.

**This is what you should strive for:**

```
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# regenerate Element component styles in theme/ from element-variables.css
npm run theme

```

#### A demo

If you can have a live accessible demo link it directly in the description. If you can not have a live demo use a [screen recorder](https://www.producthunt.com/alternatives/giphy-capture); and if that's too much to ask; have at least a few screenshots.

<https://asciinema.org/> seems cool for console recording but I have not tried it.

#### Unit test

Welcome to 2018, if your project doesn't have unit tests you should hide it. It's a bad reference and it reflects poorly on you. No excuses.
