## Not as smart either…

I mean, of course we are! But if you want your product to succeed, show how George Clooney uses it and make it sound like rhyme…

### 46. Halo Effect

The "halo effect" is when one quality of a person (or thing) is used to make an overall judgment of that person or thing. In other words, our initial impression of a person, product, company or brand affects our interpretation of its character in its entirety. For example, a tall or good-looking person will be perceived as being intelligent and trustworthy, and so on…

**How to use**: take advantage of this heuristic by using authoritative photos and visuals that build trust.

### 47. Decoy Effect

Consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when a third, asymmetrically dominating option is added.

**How to use**: define your alternatives wisely, and regardless of the number of options you plan to have - make sure they end up being 3.

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1BHhkMPSCtigBtF-xy5eOiZg15llyrFl7)

### 48. The Humor Effect

We remember information better when that information is perceived as funny or humorous.

This can help in conversion rates of products and in business in general.
How NOT to use it: don’t use humor in situations where the user might be frustrated.

For instance, if your app is not compatible with an old device - don’t say it in a funny way because the user is probably too frustrated at that point to laugh.

### 49. Rhyme-as-Reason Effect

If you thought the halo effect is lame - wait till you read this one:

Rhyming statements are perceived as more truthful.

Or as they say: “What sobriety conceals, alcohol reveals”.

**How to use**: don’t.

### 50. Illusory Truth Effect

The more something is repeated, the more we believe it.

**How to use**: Repeat your message (key benefit, main differentiator) again and again: in your ads, website, App Store page, during onboarding, newsletters, etc.

### 51. The Availability Cascade

Repeat something long enough and it’ll become true.

**How to use**: create a catchy slogan and make sure to repeat it enough to make it stick.

Oh, and if by any chance this slogan ends with a rhyme - it might work even better.

## Intelligent people are easily tricked as well

### 52. The False Consensus Bias

We tend to overestimate how much other people are like us and share our opinions, beliefs, preferences, values, and habits, and as a result - think the same way as we do.

**Question**: Without getting into politics (or specific countries), were you recently surprised by your country’s election results?

### 53. Curse of Knowledge

When we are experts in a certain field, we often fail to realize the people we talk to don’t have the background we assume they have in this field.

**UI/UX tip**: Think about the majority of your users: they are probably less technical than you think and less familiar with the things you are well familiar with.

![Curse of knowledge in UI error messages](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1pPvzI7yorcHkNBm_jP7x6-lT8kLyR48K "Curse of knowledge in UI error messages")

### 54. Projection Bias (Empathy Gap)

We assume that our current tastes and preferences to things will remain the same over time.

We are not able to place ourselves in the emotional state of our future selves, and thus make future commitments that suit our current state.

### 55. The Forer (or Barnum) Effect

We tend to give high accuracy ratings to positive personality and value descriptions that we believe are written ‘just for us’, when they are typically vague and general enough to apply to anybody.

**How to use it**: In UX Writing - approach your users/visitors directly using words such as: ‘you’, ‘your’.

### 56. Restraint Bias

We have the tendency to overestimate our ability to show restraint in the face of temptation or addiction.

**How to use**: We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?

![Restraint Bias - We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1bh_eqirdcaDDYkoXiQyReb0N2dHHdHZy "Restraint Bias - We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?")

Clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them...

### 57. Optimism Bias

We often to overestimate the odds of our own success compared to other people's.

**Product tip**: Make sure your product doesn’t hide any unpleasant surprises that might break the optimism bias (such as extra costs, possible delays, etc.)

**Work-related tip**: When planning, force yourself to be pessimistic:

1. If you believe 60% of your downloads will convert into actual users - assume 50% in your calculations.
2. If you believe a new user will cost $4, round it up to $5.
3. If your business works badly during winters - plan for long winters.
4. If your plan includes resource availability - didn’t be over-optimistic about their capacity and performance.

A plan that is conservative and still demonstrates success, is much better than an over-pessimistic one.

> Think optimistically.
> Plan pessimistically.
> Execute uncompromisingly.

### 58. Planning Fallacy

We tend to underestimate the time needed to complete a task. It’s one of the reasons why plans often break and projects get delayed. Breaking large tasks into smaller pieces helps to deal with this phenomena.

**Work tip**: multiply your initial estimations in 2, no, actually make it 3.
Do it not because you’re lazy, but because your estimations are probably wrong…

### 59. Parkinson's Law of Triviality

We tend to waste too much time on trivial topics and leave too little time to the important stuff.

Work tip: This one happens a lot in meetings: the first 1-2 items take longer than needed, not leaving enough time for the rest of the items.

A timed agenda can help fix this annoying phenomenon.

### 60. Dunning–Kruger Effect

We are unable to recognize our lack of ability.

“Our inability to recognize our lack of ability to recognize our inability. “

**Career tip**: When you join a new team or a new company, remember that there are many things you don’t know, and many things you don’t even know you don’t know…

Start low, get familiar with the people involved. Talk less and observe more.

Keep a low profile until you are no longer a novice.

### 61. Insensitivity to Sample Size

We often ignore the sample size and jump to conclusions even though the sample size is not enough statistically.

**Product management tip**: Talking to customers is important, but don’t base your product assumptions on a few interviews. Work with big numbers and base your product decisions on real data rather than assumptions.

**Illusion of Control**

We tend to overestimate our degree of influence over external events.

## Double or nothing!

Weirdly enough, when we realize we’re about to lose, and maybe because we hate losing so much - we tend to invest more on the failing option.

### 62. Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)

Once a decision is made, we tend to praise the option we selected and demote the other options.

**Product/UX hack**: Whenever a user goes through a significant step in the conversion funnel - show an affirming message, praise them, and congratulate them for achieving this step.

**Virality tip**: A great timing to ask a user to share the product (or add a review) is right after the user makes a decision to purchase that leads to a successful transaction. This moment combines a successful experience with the choice-supportive bias.

![Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1hQBoTtxdgExY1Rllc9OLHBg8T9xvj4XP "Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)")

Praise your users and congratulate them for achieving significant steps 

### 63. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

The more we invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

As a result, we often continue with a failing course of action, only because of the time, money or effort that we’ve already invested in it in the past.

**Onboarding tip**: Make it easy for your users to start with a small commitment which is fun and engaging. This will pave the way for bigger commitments later on.

**Life tip**: When you feel you’re about to go “all in” on something - take a break (few minutes, few hours, or even sleep on it) - you’ll see things differently when you are back.

### 64. Irrational Escalation (Escalation of Commitment)

We continue rationalizing a previous decision we made by repeating it (or investing even more in it), and by doing so, prove that our previous decision was correct.

**Life tip**: Don’t fall in love with your ideas just because you already invested in them. Cut your losses on time.

**Product rule**: Measure and analyze the performance of every new feature you release. Don’t trust your instincts and always be suspicious about your own decisions.

![Irrational Escalation - provide free trials to hook the user through escalation of commitment](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Eyv1r4bxniXE0hRV8gPYeomBV5UeWgYQ "Irrational Escalation - provide free trials to hook the user through escalation of commitment")

Provide free trials to hook the users through escalation of commitment

### 65. The Ostrich Effect

We deliberately avoid negative information (or feedback that isn't aligned with our hopes), thinking that if we bury our head in the sand - they will disappear.

**Question**: Have you ever received really bad customer feedback, and thought "It's just one customer, it doesn’t mean anything"?

**Product management tip**: Work alongside customer support: do it proactively, see what customers are struggling with. There’s a lot to learn from going over user complaints.

### 66. Disposition Effect

The disposition effect is an anomaly discovered in behavioral finance. It relates to the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value while keeping assets that have dropped in value.

## But don’t push it!

Persuading people might seem easier than expected, but don’t push it though. 

Building trust is a process, and if the users feel something is wrong - they become over defensive, and this is when your battle is lost.

### 67. Reactance

Reactance occurs when we feel that someone (or something) is trying to constrain our freedom by taking away our choices and limit our alternatives. When it happens, we feel an urge to resist it and do the opposite.

**Product tip**: be careful when you “argue” with a user about his selected choice.

Nudges must be gentle and elegant, and must never harm the user’s confidence.

### 68. Single Option Aversion

We are unwilling to choose an option (regardless of how attractive it is) when there are no other competing options.

**Conversion tip**: Without creating too many options - set 3 options so your customers will have alternatives, without becoming confused.

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1qQ1KSJIV1t_5qU0Lbzly40KYvGhtc4ot)

### 69. Analysis Paralysis (Choice Overload)

This bias rhymes, which means it’s probably true:

When too many options are presented, our brain shuts down and we are having a hard time choosing.

Think about overloaded restaurant menus and how overwhelming (and not fun!) they can get.

**Product rule**: Too many options = poor conversion rate.

![Analysis Paralysis - Too many options lead to poor conversion rate](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1ec1f6hMhATAPtGe7Cb0JidAhj-F-HNLQ "Analysis Paralysis - Too many options lead to poor conversion rate")

Too many options = poor conversion rate

### 70. Ambiguity Effect

We tend to avoid the unknown and do not select options that are missing information or clarity.

Minimize ambiguity by adding reassuring details and your conversion rates will improve.

**Product tip**: if you sell products - invest in the description, photos, price and delivery options.

**UI hack**: CTA buttons should include informative labels next to them, designed to clear possible uncertainties.

![Ambiguity Effect - Clarity is key for improving conversion rates](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1gKRA6UopJl-tl2b-cRLx948praM3e1UR "Ambiguity Effect - Clarity is key for improving conversion rates")

Clarity is key for improving conversion rates

### 71. Risk Compensation

We become more careful where we sense greater risk and less careful when we feel more protected.

**Product tip**: Workflows should be designed to minimize friction.

### 72. Peltzman Effect

We are more likely to act in a risky way when we know all security measures have been taken.

**UI tip**: Let your users feel as safe as possible with your product - let them gain confidence and trust, especially before making a purchase or singing-up.

### 73. Backfire Effect

We can’t change people’s beliefs that easily: evidence and argumentation in opposite to an entrenched belief will not help and will only strengthen their position.

**Work-related tip**: win people’s behavior through emotional arguments (look around you! There’s a list of relevant techniques right here!) and don’t try to change their beliefs.

## Some more mind tricks before we wrap

### 74. The Frequency Illusion (Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon)

We see new information, names, ideas or patterns 'everywhere' soon after they're first brought to our attention. For instance, if someone is thinking of buying a new car, it’s common that he suddenly sees this car everywhere.

**Marketing tip**: When pushing a campaign - make sure to expose your visitors to the same content in different marketing channels and with retargeting techniques.

### 75. Placebo Effect

Our behavior, attitude or feelings can change when we are convinced we’ve received something attributable to the change (i.e. a fake treatment).

**Marketing tip**: Belief and experience create a reality.
These stories your customers tell about your product are how your placebo effect spreads and becomes real to more and more people.

### 76. Peak-End Rule

We judge an experience based on how we felt at its’ peak and at its’ end, rather than based on the average or the total sum of it.

**Product tip**: Maintain your competitive advantage and raise your product peak moments by making your best features even better.

**Another product tip**: Don’t neglect the “after-purchase” experience of your product. Make sure to end the experience with a superb taste.

![Peak-End Rule - identify your product peaks and make them even better!](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1HLU8ZomiiyarMPsfXCjtfjgYKGYOKueg "Peak-End Rule - identify your product peaks and make them even better!")

### 77. Distinction Bias

When comparing options side-by-side, we become hypersensitive to small differences, while in fact, those differences are not so big.

**Marketing tip**: Show your product advantages next to your competitors so the visitors can notice the differences. Even the small ones.

### 78. Self-Relevance Effect

We remember events that are related to us much better than events related to others.

Makes sense…

### 79. Primacy Effect

Items at the beginning and at the end of a list are more easily recalled than items in the middle.

**UI tip**: if you plan to show a long list of items - make sure the first one is your most important item.

### 80. Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)

We think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group but then when we go through each one of them individually - they seem far less attractive.

**Marketing tip**: Use cases, testimonials, blog posts - make sure to have a few of them before you publish.

![Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Kn-TO7co7DkRKA83fGsRZfOQBTB-3SgP "Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)")

### 81. Bias Blind Spot

We notice the impact of biases on the judgment of others, but we fail to see the impact of these same biases on ourselves.

![Bias Blind Spot - we all have them](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1T-DGmrFq8A05qXtcq88akYwVG1svxr1O "Bias Blind Spot - we all have them")

### 82. Actor-Observer Bias

We tend to attribute others’ undesirable behavior to their (shitty) character, but our undesirable behavior to our circumstances.

Work tip: learn to control this bias and try to understand the other side: it can be external people (i.e. customers, partners) vs. internal people, but can also happen internally: one team vs. another, one role vs. another, etc.

### 83. Egocentric Bias

We satisfy our ego by thinking we contributed to a group effort much more than we actually did.

“Hey! did you see my last shot-blocker? It gave us the victory!”

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1GMj97tRgnKz2f6Kz2R8vaC0GiP_Vx2wJ)

### 84. Observer-Expectancy Effect

Happens when a researcher's cognitive bias causes them to subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment.

Wait… if that’s true… then… who guarantees it didn’t happen in all the researches that led to this list?
