## 也没有那么聪明……

I mean, of course we are! But if you want your product to succeed, show how George Clooney uses it and make it sound like rhyme…
我的意思是，我们当然是聪明的！但是如果你想要让你的产品获得成功，请展示乔治·克鲁尼是如何使用它的并让它听起来十分押韵。

### 46. 晕轮效应

“晕轮效应”是指用一个人（或物）的某种品质对这个人（或物）做出整体的判断。换句话说，我们对一个人、一个产品、一家公司或一个品牌的最初印象会影响我们对其整体特征的解读。举个例子，一个高大或英俊的人会被认为是聪明或值得信赖的，等等……

**如何使用**：通过使用权威照片和可建立信任关系的视觉效果来充分利用这种具有启发式的方法。

### 47. 诱饵效应

当添加第三个非主导选项时，消费者在其他两个选项之间的偏好往往会发生变化。

**如何使用**：明智地定义你的备用选项，无论你计划拥有多少个选项 —— 请确保选项的最终数量为 3。

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1BHhkMPSCtigBtF-xy5eOiZg15llyrFl7)

### 48. The Humor Effect

我们能容易记住有趣或幽默地信息。

这有助于产品和商业转化率。在何种情况避免使用：不要在用户可能感到沮丧地情况下使用幽默。

例如，当你的应用程序与一个旧设备不兼容时，不要用幽默地口吻描述它，因为用户可能会因为过于沮丧而笑不出来。

### 49. 押韵效应

如果你认为晕轮效应没有说服力 —— 等到你读到这篇文章时：

押韵的陈述被认为更加真实。

或如他们所言：“酒精揭示了清醒所隐瞒的一切（What sobriety conceals, alcohol reveals）。”

**如何使用**：别使用它。

### 50. 虚幻真实效应

事情重复越多，我们就会越相信它。

**如何使用**：在你的广告、网站、应用程序商店页、引导流程、新闻稿等地方反复重复你的信息（产品的主要优点、与其他产品的区别）。

### 51. 虚幻真相效应

当一件事重复足够长的时间，它就会变成现实。

**如何使用**：创造一个吸引人的口号，并坚持重复使用它。

哦，如果这个口号以押韵结尾的话 —— 它的效果可能会更好。

## 聪明的人也容易被欺骗

### 52. 错误共识效应

我们总是高估他人与我们的相似度，认为其他人具有和我们一样的观点、信仰、偏好、价值观和习惯，并因此 —— 以与我们相同的方式思考。

**问**：在没有涉足政坛（或特定国家）的情况下，你最近对你国家的选举结果是否感到惊讶？

### 53. 知识的诅咒

当我们是某个领域的专家时，我们常常不会意识到和我们交谈的人没有这一领域的背景。

**UI/UX 技巧**：想想你的大多数用户：他们可能没有你想的那么专业，也不太熟悉你所熟悉的东西。

![UI 错误消息中的知识诅咒](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1pPvzI7yorcHkNBm_jP7x6-lT8kLyR48K "UI 错误消息中的知识诅咒")

### 54. 投射偏误（移情隔阂）

我们认为，随着时间的推移，我们当前对事物的品味和偏好a会保持不变。

我们无法将自己置于未来的情感状态中，从而做出符合当前状态的未来承诺。

### 55. The Forer (or Barnum) Effect

We tend to give high accuracy ratings to positive personality and value descriptions that we believe are written ‘just for us’, when they are typically vague and general enough to apply to anybody.

**How to use it**: In UX Writing - approach your users/visitors directly using words such as: ‘you’, ‘your’.

### 56. Restraint Bias

We have the tendency to overestimate our ability to show restraint in the face of temptation or addiction.

**How to use**: We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?

![Restraint Bias - We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1bh_eqirdcaDDYkoXiQyReb0N2dHHdHZy "Restraint Bias - We all think clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them, don’t we?")

Clickbait titles are lame, but we all fall for them...

### 57. Optimism Bias

We often to overestimate the odds of our own success compared to other people's.

**Product tip**: Make sure your product doesn’t hide any unpleasant surprises that might break the optimism bias (such as extra costs, possible delays, etc.)

**Work-related tip**: When planning, force yourself to be pessimistic:

1. If you believe 60% of your downloads will convert into actual users - assume 50% in your calculations.
2. If you believe a new user will cost $4, round it up to $5.
3. If your business works badly during winters - plan for long winters.
4. If your plan includes resource availability - didn’t be over-optimistic about their capacity and performance.

A plan that is conservative and still demonstrates success, is much better than an over-pessimistic one.

> Think optimistically.
> Plan pessimistically.
> Execute uncompromisingly.

### 58. Planning Fallacy

We tend to underestimate the time needed to complete a task. It’s one of the reasons why plans often break and projects get delayed. Breaking large tasks into smaller pieces helps to deal with this phenomena.

**Work tip**: multiply your initial estimations in 2, no, actually make it 3.
Do it not because you’re lazy, but because your estimations are probably wrong…

### 59. Parkinson's Law of Triviality

We tend to waste too much time on trivial topics and leave too little time to the important stuff.

Work tip: This one happens a lot in meetings: the first 1-2 items take longer than needed, not leaving enough time for the rest of the items.

A timed agenda can help fix this annoying phenomenon.

### 60. Dunning–Kruger Effect

We are unable to recognize our lack of ability.

“Our inability to recognize our lack of ability to recognize our inability. “

**Career tip**: When you join a new team or a new company, remember that there are many things you don’t know, and many things you don’t even know you don’t know…

Start low, get familiar with the people involved. Talk less and observe more.

Keep a low profile until you are no longer a novice.

### 61. Insensitivity to Sample Size

We often ignore the sample size and jump to conclusions even though the sample size is not enough statistically.

**Product management tip**: Talking to customers is important, but don’t base your product assumptions on a few interviews. Work with big numbers and base your product decisions on real data rather than assumptions.

**Illusion of Control**

We tend to overestimate our degree of influence over external events.

## Double or nothing!

Weirdly enough, when we realize we’re about to lose, and maybe because we hate losing so much - we tend to invest more on the failing option.

### 62. Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)

Once a decision is made, we tend to praise the option we selected and demote the other options.

**Product/UX hack**: Whenever a user goes through a significant step in the conversion funnel - show an affirming message, praise them, and congratulate them for achieving this step.

**Virality tip**: A great timing to ask a user to share the product (or add a review) is right after the user makes a decision to purchase that leads to a successful transaction. This moment combines a successful experience with the choice-supportive bias.

![Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1hQBoTtxdgExY1Rllc9OLHBg8T9xvj4XP "Choice-Supportive Bias (Post-Purchase Rationalization)")

Praise your users and congratulate them for achieving significant steps 

### 63. The Sunk Cost Fallacy

The more we invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

As a result, we often continue with a failing course of action, only because of the time, money or effort that we’ve already invested in it in the past.

**Onboarding tip**: Make it easy for your users to start with a small commitment which is fun and engaging. This will pave the way for bigger commitments later on.

**Life tip**: When you feel you’re about to go “all in” on something - take a break (few minutes, few hours, or even sleep on it) - you’ll see things differently when you are back.

### 64. Irrational Escalation (Escalation of Commitment)

We continue rationalizing a previous decision we made by repeating it (or investing even more in it), and by doing so, prove that our previous decision was correct.

**Life tip**: Don’t fall in love with your ideas just because you already invested in them. Cut your losses on time.

**Product rule**: Measure and analyze the performance of every new feature you release. Don’t trust your instincts and always be suspicious about your own decisions.

![Irrational Escalation - provide free trials to hook the user through escalation of commitment](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Eyv1r4bxniXE0hRV8gPYeomBV5UeWgYQ "Irrational Escalation - provide free trials to hook the user through escalation of commitment")

Provide free trials to hook the users through escalation of commitment

### 65. The Ostrich Effect

We deliberately avoid negative information (or feedback that isn't aligned with our hopes), thinking that if we bury our head in the sand - they will disappear.

**Question**: Have you ever received really bad customer feedback, and thought "It's just one customer, it doesn’t mean anything"?

**Product management tip**: Work alongside customer support: do it proactively, see what customers are struggling with. There’s a lot to learn from going over user complaints.

### 66. Disposition Effect

The disposition effect is an anomaly discovered in behavioral finance. It relates to the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value while keeping assets that have dropped in value.

## But don’t push it!

Persuading people might seem easier than expected, but don’t push it though. 

Building trust is a process, and if the users feel something is wrong - they become over defensive, and this is when your battle is lost.

### 67. Reactance

Reactance occurs when we feel that someone (or something) is trying to constrain our freedom by taking away our choices and limit our alternatives. When it happens, we feel an urge to resist it and do the opposite.

**Product tip**: be careful when you “argue” with a user about his selected choice.

Nudges must be gentle and elegant, and must never harm the user’s confidence.

### 68. Single Option Aversion

We are unwilling to choose an option (regardless of how attractive it is) when there are no other competing options.

**Conversion tip**: Without creating too many options - set 3 options so your customers will have alternatives, without becoming confused.

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1qQ1KSJIV1t_5qU0Lbzly40KYvGhtc4ot)

### 69. Analysis Paralysis (Choice Overload)

This bias rhymes, which means it’s probably true:

When too many options are presented, our brain shuts down and we are having a hard time choosing.

Think about overloaded restaurant menus and how overwhelming (and not fun!) they can get.

**Product rule**: Too many options = poor conversion rate.

![Analysis Paralysis - Too many options lead to poor conversion rate](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1ec1f6hMhATAPtGe7Cb0JidAhj-F-HNLQ "Analysis Paralysis - Too many options lead to poor conversion rate")

Too many options = poor conversion rate

### 70. Ambiguity Effect

We tend to avoid the unknown and do not select options that are missing information or clarity.

Minimize ambiguity by adding reassuring details and your conversion rates will improve.

**Product tip**: if you sell products - invest in the description, photos, price and delivery options.

**UI hack**: CTA buttons should include informative labels next to them, designed to clear possible uncertainties.

![Ambiguity Effect - Clarity is key for improving conversion rates](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1gKRA6UopJl-tl2b-cRLx948praM3e1UR "Ambiguity Effect - Clarity is key for improving conversion rates")

Clarity is key for improving conversion rates

### 71. Risk Compensation

We become more careful where we sense greater risk and less careful when we feel more protected.

**Product tip**: Workflows should be designed to minimize friction.

### 72. Peltzman Effect

We are more likely to act in a risky way when we know all security measures have been taken.

**UI tip**: Let your users feel as safe as possible with your product - let them gain confidence and trust, especially before making a purchase or singing-up.

### 73. Backfire Effect

We can’t change people’s beliefs that easily: evidence and argumentation in opposite to an entrenched belief will not help and will only strengthen their position.

**Work-related tip**: win people’s behavior through emotional arguments (look around you! There’s a list of relevant techniques right here!) and don’t try to change their beliefs.

## Some more mind tricks before we wrap

### 74. The Frequency Illusion (Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon)

We see new information, names, ideas or patterns 'everywhere' soon after they're first brought to our attention. For instance, if someone is thinking of buying a new car, it’s common that he suddenly sees this car everywhere.

**Marketing tip**: When pushing a campaign - make sure to expose your visitors to the same content in different marketing channels and with retargeting techniques.

### 75. Placebo Effect

Our behavior, attitude or feelings can change when we are convinced we’ve received something attributable to the change (i.e. a fake treatment).

**Marketing tip**: Belief and experience create a reality.
These stories your customers tell about your product are how your placebo effect spreads and becomes real to more and more people.

### 76. Peak-End Rule

We judge an experience based on how we felt at its’ peak and at its’ end, rather than based on the average or the total sum of it.

**Product tip**: Maintain your competitive advantage and raise your product peak moments by making your best features even better.

**Another product tip**: Don’t neglect the “after-purchase” experience of your product. Make sure to end the experience with a superb taste.

![Peak-End Rule - identify your product peaks and make them even better!](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1HLU8ZomiiyarMPsfXCjtfjgYKGYOKueg "Peak-End Rule - identify your product peaks and make them even better!")

### 77. Distinction Bias

When comparing options side-by-side, we become hypersensitive to small differences, while in fact, those differences are not so big.

**Marketing tip**: Show your product advantages next to your competitors so the visitors can notice the differences. Even the small ones.

### 78. Self-Relevance Effect

We remember events that are related to us much better than events related to others.

Makes sense…

### 79. Primacy Effect

Items at the beginning and at the end of a list are more easily recalled than items in the middle.

**UI tip**: if you plan to show a long list of items - make sure the first one is your most important item.

### 80. Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)

We think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group but then when we go through each one of them individually - they seem far less attractive.

**Marketing tip**: Use cases, testimonials, blog posts - make sure to have a few of them before you publish.

![Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Kn-TO7co7DkRKA83fGsRZfOQBTB-3SgP "Cheerleader Effect (Group Attractiveness)")

### 81. Bias Blind Spot

We notice the impact of biases on the judgment of others, but we fail to see the impact of these same biases on ourselves.

![Bias Blind Spot - we all have them](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1T-DGmrFq8A05qXtcq88akYwVG1svxr1O "Bias Blind Spot - we all have them")

### 82. Actor-Observer Bias

We tend to attribute others’ undesirable behavior to their (shitty) character, but our undesirable behavior to our circumstances.

Work tip: learn to control this bias and try to understand the other side: it can be external people (i.e. customers, partners) vs. internal people, but can also happen internally: one team vs. another, one role vs. another, etc.

### 83. Egocentric Bias

We satisfy our ego by thinking we contributed to a group effort much more than we actually did.

“Hey! did you see my last shot-blocker? It gave us the victory!”

![](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1GMj97tRgnKz2f6Kz2R8vaC0GiP_Vx2wJ)

### 84. Observer-Expectancy Effect

Happens when a researcher's cognitive bias causes them to subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment.

Wait… if that’s true… then… who guarantees it didn’t happen in all the researches that led to this list?
