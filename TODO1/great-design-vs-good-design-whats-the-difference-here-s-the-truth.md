# 伟大设计与好设计之间区别是什么？这里告诉你真相

The lowest common denominator for interface design has risen over the last decade. You see a lot less of this now:过去十年内界面设计的最低标准已经上升，你现在看到的情况要少得多：

我们已经搞清楚如何让用户的界面看起来不错并且运行相当好。正如你在其他成熟行业中所拥有的那样，行业标准已经出现：在汽车中，你不会切换加油和制动两种踏板的位置，也不会将座椅放在汽车外部。在用户界面，你不会添加闪烁中文字或者自动播放音乐，而且你希望界面上的东西相对整洁。

对于工业来说这是一个大的进步，但是我们现在做什么呢？仅仅不再犯下最惊人的错误这样就足够了吗？或者我们应该争取更多？

我觉得数字设计领域正处于極需我们力争伟大，而不仅是满足于好的状态。

但是伟大设计长什么样呢？它跟好设计有什么区别？让我们来看看一些原则。

## 好设计提供人们想要的，伟大的设计解决人们尚未预期的问题

大约一年前，Samsung 宣布正在研发一款可折叠的智能手机。有一句话引起了我的注意：
> DJ Koh 曾说过『是时候交付一款可折叠设备了』这样的话，就在三星做出这类设备存在市场的消费者调研之后。

The fact that Samsung is almost proud to say that customer surveys are the reason the company is working on a foldable smartphone is scary.

It’s one thing to send your customers a survey on how they enjoy using a product or how a recent product repair went. However, to base product development plans on customer surveys is highly questionable.

Customer surveys would not have led to products like iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.

This is a classic example of that overused Henry Ford quote that “If we had asked the people what they wanted, they would have said ‘faster horses’”.

Great design understands that the average layperson can’t always articulate solutions — they only know they have a problem. It’s up to the designer, who lives at the intersection of technology and the creative arts, to come up with new ways of solving that problem. The designer can make unexpected connections between subjects and solve the problem in new ways.

## 好设计是数据驱动的，伟大的设计是会产生广博数据的

“Data-driven” is an interesting word combination. It literally means that the data is “driving” your decisionmaking. The data points are in the driver’s seat, not you.

This is dangerous because not everything is an optimization problem that can be solved with data. Basing all of your decisionmaking on data points that you can measure right now can lead to you losing focus of important macro aspects of the problem you’re trying to solve.

Data is just one source of information on the way to solving a problem. Hence, being “data-informed” is the way to go if you want to produce great design.

Booking.com is a great example of data-driven design. They do a lot of A/B testing to see how people best convert to booking flights and hotels on their platform.

Through their tests, they’ve discovered that adding “Urgency Messaging” drives people to book more. Urgency messaging is something like “Hey this hotel has just 4 rooms left, book soon”. That’s nice, however, over the years, booking.com has added one urgency message after another, to the point where now it looks more like a shady used car lot than like a serious place to book hotels.

![Basically the same](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*3sxLm9wyllJHpOJ1DBZcQw.jpeg)

Most recently, it has started showing you hotels you can’t even book, just to drive home that point that “people are booking hotels here at booking.com so you should too”:

![You’ve got to be kidding me](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3840/1*AsIGA9pPt_FR_9B2uRJL8Q.jpeg)

And I’m sure it works to improve conversions by 0.4%. But if you look at the whole experience, it’s really starting to degrade. That’s the type of result you get when you myopically optimize your product based on data points and single-digit improvements to conversion, without considering the overall experience.

Compare that with Hotel Tonight, one of the fastest growing hotel booking apps, recently acquired by airbnb for a few hundred million.

Hotel Tonight understands that people are trying to find a nice room to stay in, and optimizes for that. It shows larger preview images of the hotel rooms than booking.com does and has a hint of urgency messaging, but it doesn’t overpower the entire layout of the page. They are focusing on overall experience rather than just tiny conversion improvements driven by data.

## 好设计试图取悦每个用户，伟大的设计有自己的想法并会挑战共识

Great design has a worldview and values, that it executes on consistently. It doesn’t try to please everyone.

Consider Apple’s MacBook and iPad vs Microsoft’s Surface. Microsoft takes the approach of “We don’t want to make a decision on what’s the best experience for consumers, so let’s give them everything and let them decide for themselves.” In a way, they are letting the consumers design their own experience, rather than designing an experience.

What you get as a result of that is a laptop with a touchscreen and a stylus, that can also fold both ways, and you can also detach the screen. It looks nice, but what will you really use it for?

![Uhhhhhhh……](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4800/1*CzRlfWcS9D-kBUZeCw9yVQ.png)

Meanwhile, Apple takes the approach of “Let’s make technology more personal, and create tools and form factors around specific usage scenarios”.

The iPhone and iPad are designed to handle **some** tasks formerly given to laptops and desktops. In the process of creating this new form factor, the iPhone and iPad are able to handle entirely new tasks as well. A similar dynamic occurs with Apple Watch being able to handle tasks previously given to iPhone, while also handling new tasks.

In Apple’s view, the iPhone and iPad should be kept separate from Mac because each category ends up being more powerful by being true to its form factor. The idea isn’t to have these products share the same user inputs so that people can do whatever is possible on a desktop and laptop on a tablet and smartphone. Instead, each has different capabilities based on the user input method and form factor.

**That** is an opinionated approach to designing devices. Not everyone agrees with Apple’s approach, but the results are clear: [Apple products](https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/1/10886720/apple-ipad-pro-outsold-microsoft-surface-sales) have been [outselling](https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-the-apple-ipad-pro-has-massively-outsold-the-microsoft-surface.html) Microsoft’s products by a factor of 30 to 1 for [the last 4 years](https://www.imore.com/apple-outselling-microsoft-powered-computers-it-may-not-be-fair-it-mobile-centric-future).

## 伟大的设计关注细节的同时也不会忽略整体情况

You see a lot of companies right now talking about the importance of design. Salesforce released a comprehensive design system complete with a fancy name(“Lightning Design System”) and lots of illustrated mascots.

However, they neglected to properly set the typography in their design system to optimize for readability on screens. They had such a grand vision that they lost sight of the fundamentals of design.

![Ironic](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4792/1*H9o8HSUg2wGO2aQy2hQnoA.png)

Another fundamental you often see neglected these days is figure-ground contrast: Text on top of images that isn’t readable…all the while talking about how important “good design” is.

![Intercom [loves](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-and-design/) talking about how good they are at design](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5012/1*5ic1paS7UtNIcY8C_2wxcA.png)

Focusing on the flashy parts of design while neglecting the fundamentals, is like focusing only on hitting home runs in baseball, or only doing slam dunks in basketball. It’s fun to look at, but a player who neglects the fundamentals of the game will fall apart when tested in a real-life competitive environment.
> ### Great design never neglects the fundamentals on a quest to impress the world around them.

On that note….

## 好设计试图给人留下好印象，伟大的设计让人难以忘怀

> “A good designer finds an elegant way to put everything you need on a page. A great designer convinces you half that shit is unnecessary.”
> — Thomas Hutchings (@Dear**Impossible) November 14, 2013**

Good design aims to impress people with “delightful animations” and “beautiful user interfaces”. You can spot good design, break it down, and document both what you like and how it was done.

Great design is invisible. It almost feels like it wasn’t designed at all. It’s things like your MacBook unlocking automatically when you have your Apple Watch on, or your Nest thermostat adjusting to your preferred temperature when you enter a room. But it can also be something as simple as the egg cartons at the supermarket (have you ever tried designing a better egg carton?).

> Great design is invisible. It almost feels like it wasn’t designed at all. It is the outcome of painstaking thoughtfulness and a desire to help others.

## 伟大的设计拥有愿景、勇气和自我约束

Right now there’s a trend in Silicon Valley of trying to turn Design into a process that can be duplicated and reproduced no matter who you slot into the position.

Creating a clearly defined process is a great idea, especially for large companies. But when you’re working day to day in an organization at that level, it’s easy to get overly focused on optimizing the process and lose sight of what you’re building, and why. You end up iterating and optimizing on things that don’t matter. It happens to all of us sometimes.

> A big part of doing great design work is creating a compelling vision of the future, and having the courage and discipline to stick to that vision in the face of adversity.

Just following a process step-by-step doesn’t lead to great products. You can get a design that’s “Good enough” with that approach. But the difference between good design and great design is the difference between good success and great success.

Jared Spool’s recent post about [creating an experience vision](https://medium.com/@jmspool/the-experience-vision-a-self-fulfilling-ux-strategy-ce4cdb58227e) is, to me, the quintessence of what it takes to create great design:

> The easiest way to create an effective experience vision story is to start with the current experience. What makes today’s experience with our product or service frustrating for our users?
> We can ask, **“What’s the best experience we could imagine providing our users?”** undefinedWe look closely at the frustrations and imagine an experience where those frustrations don’t occur.
> Next up is to determine the timeframe of the horizon. […]Most of our experience visions come closer to a five-year horizon. […]In 5 years (or whatever horizon we pick), what is the best experience we can imagine delivering? How will people’s lives be better because we’ve removed all the frustration?

A compelling vision is what orients the “process machine” of an organization to create great products.

Defining an experience vision in that fashion is relatively easy for a skilled designer. The sustained discipline it takes to follow through on that vision makes it damn near impossible to achieve. That’s why there are so many crappy products on the market, and why most apps and websites look the same. It’s much easier to just stick to making it “good enough”.

## 拥抱伟大的设计

有许多原因让我们尝试去做伟大的工作而不仅仅是『足够好』的工作：它将你变得与众不同。它让你周围的人更加幸福，它让你更幸福，它是非常有趣并令人满意的。

但最重要的是，对你的生活你还有其他想做的事情吗？除了尽你最大的努力去让周围的世界变得更好，究竟还有什么更好的事情值得你花时间呢？如果每个人都这么做的话想想我们将会生活在什么的世界，这由你开始。
