# Envion a name of mining in block chain to support renewable energy

The IT scheme is one in every of the biggest customers of electricity worldwide. It consumes concerning one,500 TWh p.a. of electricity enough to match the ability generated by European country and Japan combined or nearly 100 percent of the electricity generated worldwide one.

In this sector, cloud computing alone accounts for 416 TWh of two.3, roughly corresponding to the carbon footprint of the complete aviation business, and is growing fast: cloud computing doubles energy consumption each four years. By 2020, it’ll grow one,400 TWh p.a. and might surpass China and therefore the u. s., the world’s largest electricity shopper, by 2030.

In the next decade, electricity could also be a scarce resource, golf stroke upward pressure on costs, if not globally then in bound places at bound times. The supply of this bottleneck is that the grid of the ability plant four. The quickest growing application in cloud computing is cryptocurrency mining.

The amount of energy consumed by Bitcoin and Ethereum exploded inside seven years from nearly zero at a pair of,010–19.2 TWh in a pair of017 that match the energy made by Iceland or Puerto RICO Act five. The energy potency of Asics and GPU has multiplied chop-chop, however has been surpassed by multiplied transactions and capitalisation.

While this exponential growth provides a superb chance for miners to urge prizes, the ability consumed by the data technology scheme additionally will increase competition for energy. solely people who have secure access to reasonable electricity will place their chips to figure.

Some demand growth are met by electricity generated from fossil fuels, however renewable energy can increase their share of energy combine from twenty fifth to thirty third between 2012 and 2040 and double their output in absolute terms.

Seen for twenty eight years, this doesn’t seem to be a hassle. Disturbance, however, happens inside this sector. On a world scale, ninetieth of all renewable energy is hydro power, which can flow from to natural limitations — grows solely slightly. which means that each one remaining growth are contained in non-hydro sectors, id est wind and star.

The amount of electricity generated by private-scale electrical phenomenon and utilities has adult exponentially from one hundred,000 MWp in 2012–390,000 in 2017.

In alternative words, the quickest growing supply of worldwide electricity provide over successive 20 years are the foremost reliable and stable supply and can rely upon weather that even supercomputers cannot predict.

This can end in farreaching: governments seeking to stabilize energy markets will impose a lot of regulation, and electricity costs can become distorted by massive deviations between countries, energy sources and client classes.

Therefore, worth volatility grows as a results of each natural laws and government intervention. The stable condition can prevail throughout the transition from the planet supported by fossil fuels and centralized energy production to a decentralised place, a renewable supply win. Over the long run.

VISION AND MISSION

We believe that innovation systems area unit essential so as for cryptocurrencies to realize mass acceptance. we tend to believe that future mining operations got to be decentralised to scale back their dependence on laws from one government, robust people, and fossils or atomic energy.

Future crypto-mining operations got to cut back the general risks ensuing from being tied to a selected coin or mining pool. Thus, the envion seeks to convey power back to the crypto-community. It ought to be attainable for people to require half in crypto-mine while not the tremendous investment in hardware and technology.

In addition to the in depth holdings of mining operations, the envion seeks to involve the general public in creating choices concerning key mining choices. thus we tend to try to scale back the obstacles for larger audiences to require half within the crypto-community.

By giving anyone the flexibility to require half in securing the long run of blockchain technology, envion is parturition the muse for the long run of crypto mining by planning a extremely mobile and low maintenance mining unit by giving our folks the proper to decide on mining locations and for coin choices.

TOKEN

EVN tokens area unit supported the ERC20 protocol,

EVN tokens provide their holders the proper to:

A.] receive 100 percent of our mining operations financial gain in 2 steps:

75% area unit detected at once

25% reinvested to boost future payments

B.] received thirty fifth of this envion financial gain from mining by third party operations

C.] votes and veto in vital choices The company’s strategic token are offered for thirty one days, beginning December fifteen, 2017 and ending on January fourteen, 2018.

EVN ICO is finished by the primary envion — mobile — the world’s mining answer — targeting energy at its terribly supply. The provide are receptive the worldwide public. Restrictions apply to Swiss and US-based investors.
