# 10 things I've learned from working remotely

I feel like the idea of working remotely is pretty divided. People either love it or hate it. After reading a lot of posts and experiencing it for myself, I decided I wanted to write a few things I've learned to help those that are on the fence about it. I've been working remotely for 16 months now and have gotten the hang of what parts work well for me.

1. Learn how to set boundaries, even with yourself

The hardest part of working from home is the fact that if you're not used to creating a structure for yourself, it becomes challenging to set boundaries. When you work in an office, there are boundaries built in. When you are in the office, you're working. When you're not in the office, you're not working. It gets a little hairier when you don't have that built in.

Here is what I do to set boundaries with myself:

- I never work in my PJs. I always physically change into something, even if it's a T-shirt and jeans, but I find the actual routine of changing gives me the boundary of PJs = sleep and/or chill time.  
- Additionally, I never work from my bed.  
- I have an office that is dedicated to where I work. I don't work in common areas because those I prefer to associate that as "home."  
- I observe when my meetings are. If I have an early meeting, I set an "Out of Office" block on my calendar after the 8-hour mark of signing on. Vice versa if I have a late meeting, I start working later. I am candid with my manager that I don't want to work over 8 hours. I haven't had issues with people abusing that. If you work at a good company, they should respect that your work should not take over your day.

## 2. Have a morning routine

Having a morning routine is absolutely key for me. I don't understand how people roll out of bed and open their computers to start working. For me, the separation between waking up and "going to work" is very important to me and has been really helpful for my mental health. I usually wake up around 7 am and get online to start work around 9:30 am.

Here is what my morning routine is like:

- Wake up  
- Go to the gym. Pump some iron or get some cardio in.  
- Cook breakfast and eat without anything work-related.  
- Meditate  
- Journal (optional, that's more on tough days)  
- Work on blog  
- Sign into work

## 3. Having a pet helps tremendously

When I got my cat, my quality of life went up so much. I actually have rejected opportunities because I don't want to leave her (which my partner thinks is silly, but he doesn't know how awesome it is). I'm sure this is also very similar if you have a pup. I imagine taking your dog for a walk is a fantastic way to take a break and stretch your legs. With my cat, she will sit next to me and cuddle, so if I am having a tough time, it really helps calm me down.

## 4. Take breaks, especially if you're feeling emotional and stressed

I take a 5-minute break every hour to walk around and stretch my legs. This is a short enough break to not completely have to re-familiarize myself with what I was working on, but long enough to really give myself a breather. This is something I do regardless if I am feeling great or awful, but it's mandatory in my workday routine.

Regarding tough times, one of my favorite things about working from home is if I am having a really tough time, I can step aside, cry and not feel self-conscious about someone seeing me. The fact that I release the energy really helps me let go and get back to work. This is 1000 times better than holding onto it for hours because of how much I am trying to hold back tears.

## 5. Get to know your conferencing software and how to use it

Know how to mute yourself and unmute yourself quickly. Make sure you're not saying snarky things while unmuted. In larger meetings, learn to use the chats within the software to ask questions.

## 6. Make plans to socialize outside of work at least once a week

I am an extrovert, so this is not difficult for me at all. I think working remotely is a little bit more difficult for introverts (my own opinion) because after working a long day, their way to recharge is to be alone. However, social interaction is always good for the soul, regardless of introversion or extraversion.

## 7. Be active in local non-work Slack communities

This is where I have met so many of my technical friends that I can actually go grab a coffee or a beer with. It's a fantastic way to network without awkwardly going to professional meetups without knowing anyone. It's also a great way to learn about meetups and events and see what meetups your internet friends are attending!

## 8. Set reminders to brush your teeth

Some people may find this gross, but I cannot tell you how many times I was working on my blog while drinking my coffee before signing onto work and just straight up forgot to brush my teeth. I set a reminder every weekday at 10:30 am, just in case I forget.

## 9. Try to set up "social time" at work

Admittedly, I am VERY bad at this. But sometimes you need little pockets of time to hang out on you conferencing software to just chat. You can even name the meeting "Water Cooler Chat." It's also really helpful for moral to do it after everyone has gone through a stressful launch of a product or website. I think the reason why I don't do this very often is that I am very much in work mode when I am at work and what I love about working remotely is not getting distracted. But some people absolutely need social time with their coworkers.

## 10. Do not force it if it doesn't work for you

You do not have to work remote. If it really is bad for your health and you struggle with these things, work in an office. I personally love it and plan on being remote for as long as I can. I love the flexibility that it adds to my life and the time I save on commuting. With all the things I am working on right now, it really allows me to have a social life even with all my side projects.

I'd love to hear, what are your tips for working remotely?

**[Fabien Ninoles](https://dev.to/ninoles):**

I have built my company for two years now, working entirely remotely (with about 20 remote devs today, most of them in Montreal area, with an office to share if necessary, but most of them are still working from home most days of the week).

I agree with all your points and would like to add some myself, about communication.

Communication is way more important when working remotely. Some think it will be an isolating experience, but, by my own experience, I found it is very easy to keep the line open with today's tools. However, I had to relearn it quite a bit:

1. You will be far more interrupt when working remotely instead of in an office. People will less hesitate to ask you a question or start a conversation because they will not know you were already engaged in other work or conversation. Which means:

2. Your exchanges will be terser, especially with people that supervise many others or are central to your organization. You have to imagine them surrounded by people like in a press conference and trying to answer everyone questions. Don't try to second-guess the intent based on what's NOT written. Ask for clarification when it's unclear. And, remember, you'll be this person too, so:

3. You really need to be more clear with your intentions. Even with emoji (or maybe even more?), intents doesn't travel that's well through chat and emails. Take the time to respond carefully, fully, and don't hesitate to request a video/audio call if necessary. Communication among people is still primarily an oral tradition, and body language is also an important part of it. And something I often forget:

4. Don't hesitate to schedule a meeting, even for 15 minutes. Create a chat room for it, if necessary. In an office, this corresponds to take a room to talk without both disturbing other, or being disturbed. Be sure that your online status says "In a meeting" during this time. This way, your conversation will be more productive and you'll keep the noise level at a minimum for everyone.

5. Well, that's my tips. No as well broad as yours but I hope that could help some people to join in the remote wagon. My quality of life has greatly improved since I did, and I'm pretty sure it is a step in the right direction to reduce the impact urbanization and promotes our more rural regions.
