# Fun places to learn CSS Layout –  Part 2: Grid Layout

![](https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/places-learn-css-grid.jpg)

2 years ago (gosh!) I wrote a small article with a few [Fun places to learn CSS Layout –  Part 1: Flexbox](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/fun-places-learn-css-layout-part-1-flexbox/). I have to be honest, I wanted to write the second part about Grid Layout for a while now but never really took the time to do so. I spoke about Grid Layout for the first time 6 years ago (gosh x2!) in my article about the [The State Of Responsive Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/the-state-of-responsive-web-design/) in 2013. This spec caught my attention from the start, but is wasn’t quite ready at the time.

Since then, a lot has changed and now [Grid Layout is supported in most major browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid). Credits where due, we owe [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) and [Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com/) a LOT when it comes to the Grid Layout specification!!! Grid Layout is an amazing set of CSS properties that will let you specify a grid layout system for you site with rows, columns and place your content accordingly. Pretty cool, right?

The syntax might be a little bit complex to learn if you come from good old floats, so here are some fun places, tutorials and sand box sites to help you learn and master everything you need to know about Grid Layout. Enjoy!
