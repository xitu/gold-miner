# A quick beginner’s guide to drawing

6 drawing exercises to get you started right now!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rUnTj2M6B-pWZAGEJzUXIQ.gif)

The **basic craft of drawing** is about two things: you learn **to control your hand** and **to see**.

_Tip: For the following 6 exercises I suggest you_ **_stick with one pen and one particular type of paper_** _(for instance A5)._

### Dexterity — two workouts

The first two exercises are about controlling your hand. We want to **build muscles** and train our **hand-eye-coordination**. Mechanical exercises like these are great for beginners. Later on you might use them to **explore new pens** or get started **when you don’t know what to draw** yet.

They are also terrific ways to relax your mind.

#### Exercise 1: Circles — more is more!

> **Distribute circles of various sizes on a piece of paper until the paper is filled. Make sure the circles do not overlap.**

Drawing circles is [not as easy as you might think](https://medium.com/personal-growth/why-perfection-is-boring-1079cb3bf5d1). Notice how the circles become harder, the bigger you make them? Try them in both directions — and make lots of them.

_Tip:_ **_Shake your hand_** _when it starts cramping! This is a workout for our hands after all._

#### Exercise 2: Hatching — the joy of structure

> **Fill a piece of paper with parallel lines.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZyZQbd50EXj65XdE8RirNg.gif)

Diagonal lines come easiest for us because **they comply to the motion of our wrist**. Did you notice how left-handed people prefer the opposite direction than right-handed people? Have a look at drawings by your favourite draughtswoman or draughtsman (in my case: [Leonardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci)), and guess which hand they used!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3FcbNajSFhjajSCEluEJFg.gif)

**Now make sure to try other directions as well**. Have fun! Combine various hatchings and enjoy watching the darkness spread on your paper.

_Tip:_ **_Don’t rotate the paper_**_. The whole point here is to train your hand to get comfortable with_ **_all_** _directions._

**So now that we have worked our hands a little, let’s train our eyes!**

### Perception — learning to see

Drawing is mainly about [**seeing and understanding what you see**](https://medium.com/personal-growth/stop-taking-pictures-and-start-drawing-b1642aded2b6). People often assume that everybody sees the same, but actually seeing is a skill which you can improve. **The more you draw, the more you see.** The next four exercises **will make you see more**.

#### Exercise 3: Contour — Show me your hands!

> **You see all those fascinating contours of your hand? Collect them on a piece of paper! Don’t try to draw the whole hand yet, just pick some of those lovely lines.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cZ2zA0W-UhXNDrbrghC6ww.gif)

Whether you draw a person, a plant, or your favourite animal, it is usually the **contours** that define a body or object and make others **recognise** them. The challenge is less to draw those distinctive lines but rather **to see them** in the first place!

**Even if you think you already know the shape of an object, it is always worth to take a closer look and rediscover it**.

#### Exercise 4: Chiaroscuro — folding light and darkness

> **Arrange and draw a piece of cloth. Start with the contours and then — using your hatching skills — create an interplay of light und darkness.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*573JHUFPYcHCIa-Ai6_1EQ.gif)

This exercise gives you a sense for light and darkness. I have to admit it is not the easiest and might as well be part of an advanced tutorial. Keep in mind: **This one is not about getting it perfectly “right”**. The cloth is a **playground** to try out those various hatchings you have practised before and feel how you can create light and shadows with your — almost — bare hands!

_Tip: You can use_ **_curved hatching_** _to modulate the shapes, and_ **_crosshatching_** _to achieve darker areas that resemble woven structures._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jiVJAU_YuHy_f4zJg47ORg.gif)

_Tip: Close your eyes just a little bit when you look at the cloth. You will see everything blurred, but you will also_ **_see an enhanced contrast between light and dark_**_._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oUcRLSSkj9vtMZDxLc1Ivw.gif)

The arrangement of light is a great way to **show what is important** in a picture. Just have a look at paintings by [Rembrandt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt_van_Rijn) or [Georges de la Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_de_La_Tour). And the next time you watch a movie look out for dramatic effects achieved with light and shadow.

#### Exercise 5: Perspective — lost in space

> **Let’s draw some cubes! Just follow the simple steps below.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*7SGLqdcPGZUuDty_3ozYvg.gif)

Perspective drawing is basically a **projection of a 3D environment on a 2D surface** (your piece of paper).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dpjQq5D0nfEYIYlKsNVGYw.gif)

Constructing perspective drawings is a bit of a science and cannot be covered in detail within the attention span of an online article. Nevertheless we can have some fun with **a simple technique** that gives us **an intuitive feel** for the magic of perspective drawing:

**_Step 1:_** Draw a horizontal line. This is the **horizon** of your picture.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HBIymxEYZI2x3I3s_e_IDw.gif)

**_Step 2:_** Define two points on the horizon near the edge of the paper. These are your two **vanishing points**.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1uFonMBvFQ3eNL9e7BcGGw.gif)

**_Step 3:_** Draw a vertical line somewhere.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b2GHhfd_-4XHLggXP0ZxDg.gif)

**_Step 4:_** Connect the endpoints of the vertical line with the vanishing points.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IogkqeVs_51JOG2El6l46A.gif)

**_Step 5:_** Add two vertical lines like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b4uEYTxOtx91ilLdFD-vQQ.gif)

**_Step 6:_** Connect them with the vanishing points.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VpcqF0gbtjKS2HzA9cvReg.gif)

**_Step 7:_** Now use a dark pencil or pen to emphasise the cube. Voilà!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cAuyUJ969E81XvR_p9u4qg.gif)

**Repeat steps 3–7 as often as you like.** Have fun! If you feel adventurous you might even hatch the sides of the cubes.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bP1gGRnZ4YFgbp3pRSPt_g.gif)

_Tip: When you draw lines that meet, it is usually a good idea to be confident and_ **_let them overlap a little bit_**_. The shapes will look better defined._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GSak0juhukCviIpl9vwH_A.gif)

Mastering perspective drawings will give you the power to create illusions of depth. But most importantly, **you teach your brain how to think in three dimensions**. So even if you choose to draw “flat” drawings or mess with the “rules” of perspective — which I like to do —** to understand perspective drawing is still one of the most precious drawing skills you can learn**.

#### Exercise 6: Composition — Why is this there?

> **Make 5 different drawings of an object. Arrange the object differently on the paper each time!**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g4mywtKL2Gvc4H5gMcfKEA.gif)

Composition is a great tool to **“say” something with a drawing**, to **shape its meaning or message**.

To understand how it works we have to bear in mind that our perception has been **shaped by everyday experiences**. For instance horizontal and vertical lines seem more “stable” to us than diagonals, which might “fall over” any second. And when we see a big dark shape at the bottom we somehow assume it must be “heavy”.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vl77WjyBwGQO5DDvU8X8YQ.gif)

As you try different arrangements of your subject on a piece of paper, notice how this changes their connotations — their meaning.
