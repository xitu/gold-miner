# The most famous data visualisation ever and what we can learn from it

Napoleon’s invasion of Russia

### You need data visualisation

Data visualisation is a huge part of both Data Science and Machine Learning (ML), no doubt about it. Before creating your ML model, you need to _understand_ the data you’re going to feed it. This is usually done through an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA); Kaggle has some great [examples](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) of this!

Data visualisation is a part of EDA where we create a _visual graphic_, a specific **_depiction_** of our data in order to more clearly understand its features and properties. Visualising our data makes things so much easier because the information we are looking for can be emphasised right in front of us. Visualisations often use many different colours, shapes, sizes, and charts to trigger natural visual queues and convey a clearer picture of the data than nitty gritty numbers ever could!

Plain and simple, you need data visualisation.

### The Invasion

Perhaps the most famous data visualisation is that of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia shown above. It’s used in the introductory lecture of nearly every data visualisation course you’ll ever see.

Now, French might not be your native language…. but that’s the beauty of this visualisation: you can understand everything in **picture form.**

### The flow

Right off the get go you can see that there is a clear _flow_ to the picture from left to right. This naturally matches with how writing is done in most languages, offering an intuitive guide for reading and understanding what is depicted. It looks like Napoleon’s army started in Kowno and ended up in Moscow.

_Positioning_ is also used as a visual queue to show the direction that the army travelled. We can see how the army started off on the left in the west and proceeded towards the north east. It wasn’t a fully direct path though.

Perhaps the army had to manoeuvre around some rough terrain or obstacles, maybe even the boarders of enemy countries too. Either way we definitely know they took some type of indirect path.

### Size, shape, and colour

_Size_ and _Shape_ also play key rolls in **quantifying**  certain key properties. On the left, the shape started out as very big and slowly got smaller and smaller. This would make sense either due to army defectors, death from war, or the harsh weather conditions (more on this later).

Towards the beginning of the journey between _Kowno_ and _Wilna_, we see a small, almost vertical part join the larger part of the shape. This was probably some later joining reinforcements. As we move along to the right we later see that some of the army broke off and headed to _Polotrk_.

_Colour_ and _shape_ are also combined as with the black shape of the visualisation. It is notably smaller than the other one. It does follow the same flow and reaches the same destination, but it takes a different path. Perhaps Napoleon had a separate army division which he used to attack the flanks!

It looks like some of the army that went to _Polotrk_ ended up joining this black coloured group midway through the trip!

We also see that the black group _grows_ in size as opposed to the other group, maybe because they joined in later and the weather was better (again, more on this later).

We can probably say that Napoleon had 2 separate divisions to attack and that overall his army diminished in size quite greatly over time.

### Using lines, numbers, and text to reveal details

Using text in a visualisation can often be quite dangerous, since the usual point of drawing a picture is to see things visually! But, this depiction of Napoleon’s invasion does it right.

The numbers are sparsely and intelligently placed to further emphasise just the right details without over cluttering the picture. Numbers are placed beside the shapes for the army to exactly quantify it’s size, if you wanted that extra detail. The details are there if you want them, but not in your face if you don’t!

The map’s scale on the right is well placed and not in anything’s way. Rivers are drawn roughly as to not be glaring and in your face. The author seems to have understood that the main purpose of drawing those rivers, in the context of depicting the march of an army, was to show their position.

We can see that at the 2 right-most rivers, the size of the black coloured army grew! Perhaps they resupplied at the towns there. Either way the drawing of the rivers serves the right purpose of depicting their landmarks.

The lines at the bottom are drawn down to what looks like a vertical chart. The chart depicts the temperature throughout the journey. Because of it’s simplicity, it’s quite intuitive and easy to read; higher up on the chart means higher temperatures!

We can see from left to right that over time temperatures got warmer. We now know that the attack began in the Winter and ended in the Spring!

### TLDR: Or how to make an effective visualisation

(1) Make it intuitive. Appeal to the natural human way of understanding things visually. Left to right, up and down, bigger and smaller.

(2) Use the most basic and primitive visual queues: size, shape, colour, position. Shape and position are great for depicting flow. Colour and shape are for grouping. Size is for quantifying. All of these are general rules of course.

(3) Use text, lines, and numbers to emphasise important details.

(4) Know what’s important and emphasise it; know what isn’t and leave it out.

(5) Don’t over clutter the picture, only show what’s necessary. Positioning is very important.
