## Easily convinced

The art of persuasion! Here are some (cheap?) tricks to help you better convey your message.

### 22. Anchoring Effect:

We tend to rely too heavily on the first piece of information presented to us (the “anchor”) to make subsequent decisions.

**How to use it**: The oldest trick in the book: you add a high price as the anchor and then cross it out and set a much lower price next to it.

Looking at how Steve Jobs used it with the iPad launch I must ask: did it really work?

![Anchoring Effect - Performed by Apple's Steve Jobs during the iPad launch](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1hE2NPk3sVnoS3eO1RqMCAltJj9qtDTR2 "Anchoring Effect - Performed by Apple's Steve Jobs during the iPad launch")

Nevertheless, here’s my take on the Anchoring Effect:

Anchoring Effect in product pricing

### 23. Hyperbolic Discounting

We prefer an immediate payoff (even if it’s small) rather than a larger-later reward.

**Tip**: offer a small discount (or free shipment) for immediate purchase, rather than a larger discount for future purchases.

![Hyperbolic Discounting - Offer small discounts for an immediate purchase](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1qjNmi6biEjEB9hP8HexcdV_d410gyVKo "Hyperbolic Discounting - Offer small discounts for an immediate purchase")

Offer small discounts for an immediate purchase 

### 24. Social Proof

If people like us are using it - it must be good!

Right?

**How to use it**: Social proof is a great way to build trust. Here are a few examples that can be used in your website, [App Store product page](http://www.mobilespoon.net/2019/04/lessons-learned-app-store-screenshots.html "Lessons learned from our app store screenshots redesign - the mobile spoon"):

1. Well known customer logos
2. Well known partner logos
3. Testimonials and authentic recommendations by customers (from the target audience)
4. Counters (number of customers, deals, sessions - whatever works)
5. Media mentions and quotes (“as seen on…”)
6. Awards by well-known organizations (i.e. hottest startup by WIRED)
7. Certifications
8. Links to case studies with actual numbers

![Social Proof - Build trust using counters and customer logos](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Q9lHYKquIMlrpRXvWohwcC1Rp4-g7kiG "Social Proof - Build trust using counters and customer logos")

Don’t say: “we are awesome because… “, and instead, let others testify:

![Social Proof - Don’t say “We are awesome because…” and instead, let others testify](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1XaHyFHqHFmG-XlW_81CF8ZZlh24iVW7m "Social Proof - Don’t say “We are awesome because…” and instead, let others testify")

### 25. Authority Bias 

We attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure and be more influenced by that opinion (even if the subject is unrelated to the person’s authority).

**How to use**: Build your authority by promoting your famous references:

1. Contact influencers and give them free access to your product or service
2. Highlight famous customers or brands
3. Testimonials by famous people and celebrities
4. Use authority figures in your visuals and statements (i.e. doctors, professors, etc.)

![Authority Bias - Promote your strongest references](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1nU53Zted9Esavdatf_VCeoiAFP1f8ps9 "Authority Bias - Promote your strongest references")

### 26. Bandwagon Effect (Herd Behavior)

We often do things only because “everyone is doing it!” (Ketogenic diet anyone?).

We change our opinions, according to the number of people thinking the same way.

**Marketing tip**: convince that everyone is using your product and more people will indeed use it.

![Bandwagon Effect - Convince that others are using it](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1eV9oOXnVE-fNunuBH4vryKtwWQinGLoc)

And here’s another example for the using the Bandwagon Effect in your product:

![Bandwagon Effect - The “Most Popular” Example](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1rcPAf96BP_A9YfBa8AdFJJnd4eSRli9r "Bandwagon Effect - The “Most Popular” Example")

The “Most Popular” example 

### 27. Belonging Bias

We are all social creatures and in order to feel part of a group we often act like other members in that group. If all the software developers are using Slack - you probably should too, right?

**Copy tip**: Use counters such as the number of customers, sessions, services provided, to convince the audience that your product is a standard.

### 28. In-group Bias

Once we are part of a group, we almost “automatically” favor members in our group over members in other groups.

In-group favoritism also means we help members of our group more often than those in other groups.

![In-group Bias](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1f8GJpWMyrUWOlAr1PctUrs-B2BLJlABp "In-group Bias")

### 29. Not-Invented-Here Syndrome

We avoid using (or buying) already existing products, because of their external origins, and prefer to invent similar products internally.

Example: When your engineering team prefers to develop something from scratch instead of using an existing product.

**Management tip**: Tackle this phenomenon by complimenting your team. Their expertise is needed to develop the core of the product and their precious time cannot be “wasted” on side modules, or services that are already invented by others.

### 30. Belief Bias

We are more likely to accept an argument that supports a conclusion that aligns with our prior knowledge while rejecting counter-arguments to the conclusion.

**Writing tip**: When talking about the benefits of your product - don’t exaggerate.

If it’s too good to be true - people will not believe it.

### 31. Foot-in-the-door Technique

A small agreement creates a bond between us and the requester and potentially makes it easier for us to agree on bigger agreements.

**Subscription tip**: Give your users a free trial to hook them up with something small.

**Onboarding UX tip**: Don’t overwhelm the user with over-complicated onboarding tasks.

Break it into small/easy chunks to achieve small wins and keep the user happy and engaged.

![Foot-in-the-door Technique - Make onboarding easy by creating “small wins"](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1MpxTvnkZoqBD8Wtqy3gx708rpl0axjxa "Foot-in-the-door Technique - Make onboarding easy by creating “small wins"")

Achieve small wins during the onboarding process 

### 32. Variable Reward

Our joy from getting rewards increases when the rewards are unexpected.

**Product tip:** Hook your users with daily offers, free bonuses, reputation points, prizes and more. 

The more “action” you create on a daily basis - the more your users will feel connected and hooked to the product.

![Variable Reward - Hook your users with daily offers, free bonuses, reputation points, prizes and more.](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1aNyfch7QCQln-rC_IhxZY077ucAyDX14 "Variable Reward - Hook your users with daily offers, free bonuses, reputation points, prizes and more.")

Hook your users with daily offers, free bonuses, reputation points, prizes and more 

## Not as rational as we think

Make rational decisions is not as easy as it seems.

### 33. The Gambler's Fallacy

We mistakenly believe that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future.

**Work-related tip**: Stick with facts. Less intuition, more numbers.

### 34. Confirmation Bias:

We seek and favorite information that confirms our initial belief and preconception.

**Question**: Did you ever manipulated your KPI reports, again and again, switching from weeks to months, from months to quarters, until finding the conclusion you were looking for?

### 35. Disconfirmation Bias

We tend to dismiss evidence that refutes our beliefs.

**Question**: Did you ever like a candidate (during a job interview) so much that you ignored some warning signs?

### 36. Framing Effect

Our decision-making processes are not always as rational as we think and we are influenced by the way the information is presented (positive vs negative frames).

Product tip: In most cases, positive frames (i.e. glass is half full) convert better.

![Framing Effect - Try to present the full half of the cup for better conversion](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Lc6vP6HPyktJ8kk2XaoPVqLQKxiu7LNO "Framing Effect - Try to present the full half of the cup for better conversion")

A positive frame in action 

### 37. Context Effect

Our perception of things is influenced by the context in which they are presented or happening.

In visual design, a color or a size of an object can be perceived differently depending on where and how they are presented.

![Context Effect in design](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1HGFPufdKBckl6ADB9QPFEYgrBiq1SBSX "Context Effect in design")

### 38. Selective Perception

Our perception of things is highly influenced by our expectations.

**Product & marketing tip**: Your product’s conversion funnel doesn’t begin when the user boards, it begins when the user sees your ad for the first time.

Misalignment between the marketing message and what the product delivers will disappoint your users and result in poor conversion rates.

Aligning the messages across all media (and stages of the funnel) will bring users with the right expectations and as a result - improve conversion rates.

### 39. Hot-hand Fallacy

A fallacious belief that a person who has experienced success has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.

**How to use**: Emphasize a list of successes stories to build your strong brand.

![Hot Hand Fallacy - If Ashton Kutcher invested in this startup it must be good, right? ](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1USmoXr5h3-KqGtaLIoi4XWV6V9MuASsj "Hot Hand Fallacy - If Ashton Kutcher invested in this startup it must be good, right? ")

If Ashton Kutcher invested in this startup it must be good, right? 

### 40. Anticipation:

Our brain is wired to anticipate positive experiences. Anticipation contributes to our happiness.

**Examples**: Waiting a few months for a big vacation contributes to the overall experience. Buying early tickets to Avengers: Endgame makes us all excited and happy.

**Product tip**: Create anticipation for your new product (or release) by announcing it ahead of time. Create a positive buzz, something to look forward to, ensuring your audience will remain excited.

### 41. Information Bias

We seek information even when it cannot affect our action.

**Product tip**: When presenting products or services (in your website or within your product itself) - make sure to include photos a detailed description. The more information you can pile on to product description, the greater the assurance your users will get.

## Not as thorough as we say we are

Sure, we did the research before making the decisions, we just forgot a few things along the way, that's all... 

### 42. Availability Heuristic (Availability Bias)

We think that things that jump quickly to mind are more common and important than the things that do not easily come to mind. As a result, what’s recent, frequent, extreme, remembered, is more influential than the majority of information.

**UI tip**: make your design rememberable by creating something unique that stands out (without compromising on consistency and familiarity).

![Availability Heuristic (Availability Bias)](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1OPjCDK5T34-JUt-9UcwnMvql4CgLkBP4 "Availability Heuristic (Availability Bias)")

### 43. Attentional Bias

When examining all possible outcomes - we tend to focus on a few that seem rational and familiar and ignore all others.

**Question**: Did you ever release a feature thinking that it would lead to a certain outcome only to discover it caused a side effect you failed to anticipate?

![Attentional Bias](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1SKWO5ipZk7aZbiy1pxDIGIoa7SyWx8a8 "Attentional Bias")

### 44. Fluency Heuristic

We give higher value to things that are processed faster, fluently, and smoothly.

Sometimes illogical argument, if communicated well (by someone who has authority and experience presenting things) might win.

![Fluency heuristic](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1w7igcsMZwzEdFPgPCfrzXnTrlYjZ9p80 "Fluency heuristic")

A related term here is “**Mental Shortcuts**” - people frequently use heuristics to make decisions; you should use them to your advantage in your design.

**Product tips:**

1. Make things easy for your users (fast, simple and easy navigation)
2. Make content easily scannable (images, readable fonts)
3. Create “mental shortcuts” that will hook your users and promote the preferred behavior.
4. Provide meaningful defaults, because users assume you have their best interests in mind and will select the default options whenever possible.
5. Add a powerful cross-product search to ease the finding of specific topics.

Examples:

Here are 2 examples for making things easier for the user, in order to promote the preferred behavior for the business.

![Users expect products to provide ready-to-use defaults](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1VqWeo2F654LMST8Ipcko1KUgNeMmwZ1r "Users expect products to provide ready-to-use defaults")

Users expect products to provide ready-to-use defaults

![Fluency Heuristic in product design - providing easy shortcuts for recent activity](https://alexdenk.eu/blogtouch?id=1Wg1I6YLnShB81rgKM2JVQ_L0FYPTwhJw "Fluency Heuristic in product design - providing easy shortcuts for recent activity")

Provide simple shortcuts for recent activities 

**Work-related tip**: Always do your homework: collect enough data, write down your points, think about how to present your points, invest in the design of things.

### 45. The Google Effect (AKA: Digital Amnesia)

We forget information that can be easily found online.
**Question**: Do you remember the phone number of your best friend or kid?
