# Xcode and LLDB Advanced Debugging Tutorial: Part 3

In the first and second parts of this three parts tutorial, we‚Äôve covered how to utilize Xcode breakpoints to manipulate an existing property value and inject a new line of code via expression statements. We‚Äôve also explored watchpoints that are a special type of breakpoints.

I developed a demo project with several intentional bugs to elaborate on how to use different types of breakpoints alongside the LLDB to fix bugs in your project/application.

If you didn‚Äôt go through **[part 1](https://github.com/xitu/gold-miner/blob/master/TODO1/xcode-and-lldb-advanced-debugging-tutorial-part-1.md)** and **[part 2](https://github.com/xitu/gold-miner/blob/master/TODO1/xcode-and-lldb-advanced-debugging-tutorial-part-2.md)** undefinedof this tutorial, it‚Äôs crucial to check them before proceeding with this final part.

One last time, the golden rule of this tutorial:

You‚Äôre not to stop the compiler or re-run the application after running it for the very first time. You‚Äôre fixing the bugs at runtime.

## Symbolic Breakpoints üî∂

How are we doing so far?

> 4. The left navigation bar label that indicates how many times the user did load posts is not being updated.

Here are the steps to reproduce the last bug you‚Äôre to deal with:

‚ú¶ Scroll to the top of the table view, and pull down to refresh.

‚ú¶ Scroll to the bottom of the table view to load new posts. [for 7 times üòâ]

‚ú¶ The left label is not being updated for every time new posts are successfully retrieved.

It‚Äôs important to point out that the integer `pageNumber` property answers the question, how many times the user did load posts..? (i.e. the left label on the navigation bar should be updated by the value of the `pageNumber` property). We‚Äôre quite sure from the previous fixes that the `pageNumber` property is updated properly, hence the problem is with setting its value to the dedicated label on the navigation bar.

In such cases, symbolic breakpoints strike in. Think of symbolic breakpoints as if the debugger is playing treasure hunt and you‚Äôre providing it with clues to get to that treasure. In your case, that happens to be the piece of code that updates the left label on the navigation bar.

Let me show you how to do that.

Show the breakpoint navigator, and click on the + button on the bottom left corner. Select symbolic breakpoint.

Add the following symbol

```
[UILabel setText:]
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2052/1*bd0Xm4s2qxGAAlPafpuHgQ.png)

**Don‚Äôt** check the ‚ÄúAutomatically continue after evaluating actions‚Äù box.

What we‚Äôre simply doing here is informing the debugger that whenever the setText function of any UILabel is called, it should pause. Notice that after creating the symbolic breakpoint, a child has been added.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*pCPLepbfpWKJrNUfpprfow.png)

It‚Äôs a feedback from the debugger that it was able to resolve the created symbolic breakpoint to a specific location inside `UIKitCore` framework. In other cases, the debugger might resolve the symbolic breakpoint to multiple locations.

Now you‚Äôre all set, pull down to refresh the posts table view. As soon as you release, the debugger will pause, and you‚Äôll be seeing something like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5676/1*qxcTdnmPUempljXsANz62Q.png)

At this point, you‚Äôre looking at some assembly code of the UIKitCore framework and on the left side is the stack trace that did cause the debugger to pause. The next thing we want to do is to inspect the arguments passed into the Objective-C message the debugger did pause at. In the lldb console, type the following:

```
po $arg1
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4448/1*V33e1RQgoWtwNI8qy-AVJQ.png)

This does point out to the register that holds the first argument. We can clearly see that the receiver of that Objective-C message is a UILabel instance. The UILabel instance has a text value that refers to a post label. It‚Äôs not what we are interested in, but let‚Äôs proceed with the registers inspection.

In the lldb console, type the following:

```
po $arg2
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*RF7qzO66OUAAZ61TwKg2GA.png)

The $arg2 does always refer to the selector of the Objective-C message. In some cases, the lldb doesn‚Äôt implicitly know the types of the arguments, and hence we need to do some typecasting.

In the lldb console, type the following:

```
po (SEL)$arg2
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*f7lc9OC3NZGDTpOssJ3PBQ.png)

Now, we can clearly see the selector of the current Obj-c message.

In the lldb console, type the following:

```
po $arg3
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*saKLYWOujvPhkmf3qcBD5g.png)

The $arg3 does always refer to the first parameter passed into the method. In our case, that is the string that is passed to the setText method.

Continue the execution of the program. The debugger will pause again. Repeat the above steps and eventually, you‚Äôll figure out that the objective-c message belongs to another label of a post in the table view. It‚Äôs quite nonsense to keep doing this over and over again till we reach the UILabel instance that we are interested in. Things can definitely be better.

One thing you can do is to set a condition for the symbolic breakpoint to pause the debugger upon the success/fulfilment of that condition. This can be checking on a boolean value or waiting for a specific state to be reached .. etc.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2060/1*bDOd5KQn_VzWy8mA6OEcVA.png)

However, we‚Äôre going for a different approach.

### One Shot!

Disable the symbolic breakpoint you‚Äôve created.

Logically speaking, the left navigation bar label that indicates how many times the user did load posts is updated after the posts are successfully retrieved via the HTTP GET request. Navigate to the section with the pragma mark `Networking`. Place a breakpoint inside the success completion handler of `loadPosts`. It should be **below**:

**Objective-C**

```
[self.tableView reloadData];
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3180/1*7MH01DMLDpUFGrBz0P4MkA.png)

**Swift**

```
self.tableView.reloadData()
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2776/1*I69SoCZ3fAlaviM0WUWTXA.png)

This will assure that the symbolic breakpoint will get triggered only after the table view has been reloaded and all of its equivalent labels have been updated.

**Don‚Äôt** check the ‚ÄúAutomatically continue after evaluating actions‚Äù box. Add the following debugger command action:

```
breakpoint set --one-shot true -name '-[UILabel setText:]'
```

ü§®üßêü§î

Let‚Äôs break that command:

1. breakpoint set --one-shot true does create a ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù breakpoint. A one-shot breakpoint is a type of breakpoint that only exists till it‚Äôs triggered then it gets automatically deleted.

2. `-name ‚Äò- [UILabel setText:]‚Äô` does set a symbolic name to the created one-shot breakpoint. It‚Äôs quite similar to the one you created in the last section.

Let me recap this part. Here‚Äôs what you did:

1. Adding a breakpoint (A) in the success completion handler of the function that executes the posts GET request.

2. Adding a debugger command action to ****create**** a symbolic breakpoint (B) similar to the one you created the last section. Its symbol is the `UILabel` `setText` function.

3. Setting the symbolic breakpoint (B) you created to be a one-shot breakpoint. It‚Äôs guaranteed that the symbolic breakpoint will pause the debugger only once since a one-shot breakpoint gets deleted automatically after it has been triggered.

4. Breakpoint (A) is located after reloading the table view so that the created symbolic breakpoint (B) doesn‚Äôt pause the debugger for any of the labels related to the table view.

Now pull down the table view to refresh. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll get:

![Objective-C](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2332/1*JLBQAj7srx3twyCnScnVSg.png)

![Swift](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2044/1*2gcJPkL-VZ3HIebwOsqMZA.png)

The debugger did pause at the breakpoint (A) and hence setting the one-shot symbolic breakpoint.

Continue the program execution.

You‚Äôre back to the assembly code of the UIKitCore framework.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5676/1*qxcTdnmPUempljXsANz62Q.png)

Let‚Äôs inspect the Objective-C message of the symbolic breakpoint arguments.

In the lldb console, type the following:

```
po $arg1
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3712/1*U7on9rNp2KTxH0vBu_5pwg.png)

WELL WELL WELL, looks like you finally found your treasure !! ü•áüèÜüéâ

Time to shift our sights to the stack trace. **Step to point 1.**

![Objective-C](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4728/1*kx3XCFR0kcnpD5XC1tqtng.png)

![Swift](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3788/1*42LvhyQXygvMOF0dWphR2g.png)

It led you to the piece of code that is updating the `pageNumberLabel` text. It‚Äôs quite obvious that the text is always set to a string with a format of integer value `0` rather than the `pageNumber` property. Let‚Äôs test it before we make actual changes to our code.

You‚Äôre an expert now üß¢

Add a breakpoint in a separate line below the marked line of code. Add the following debugger command action:

**Objective-C**

```
expression self.pageNumberLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Page %tu", self.pageNumber]
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3520/1*VzRgynkwtDmcMFBveP1BrQ.png)

**Swift**

```
expression pageNumberLabel.text = String(format: "Page %tu", pageNumber)
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3564/1*IreVT3ZC9rTiC8B60WcxSw.png)

Remove/Disable breakpoint(A), accordingly, this will disable breakpoint(B)

Now pull to refresh and scroll to load more posts. The left navigation bar label is being updated. üéâ

Mission Accomplished !! üí™ üí™

You can now stop the compiler and add the fixes we discussed in your code.
