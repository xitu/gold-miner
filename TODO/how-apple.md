Once upon a time, Apple was known for designing easy-to-use, easy-to-understand products. It was a champion of the graphical user interface, where it is always possible to discover what actions are possible, clearly see how to select that action, receive unambiguous feedback as to the results of that action, and have the power to reverse that action—to undo it—if the result is not what was intended.
曾几何时，苹果公司因为产品设计易于使用和易于理解而闻名。作为图形用户界面的冠军，它总是能够让用户知道可以进行什么操作，清楚地了解如何进行这些操作，收到关于操作结果的明确反馈，并且有权力撤销与预期不符的操作。

No more. Now, although the products are indeed even more beautiful than before, that beauty has come at a great price. Gone are the fundamental principles of good design: discoverability, feedback, recovery, and so on. Instead, Apple has, in striving for beauty, created fonts that are so small or thin, coupled with low contrast, that they are difficult or impossible for many people with normal vision to read. We have obscure gestures that are beyond even the developer’s ability to remember. We have great features that most people don’t realize exist.
然而现在却不再如此。尽管现在的产品确实比以前更漂亮，但是美丽是付出了巨大的代价换来的。良好设计的基本原则已经一去不复返了：可发现性、反馈、恢复等等。作为替代，苹果公司致力于追求美观，创造出的字体很小或者很细，再加上低对比度。我们有连开发者自己都记不住的模糊手势。我们有很多人都不会注意到存在的出众特性。

The products, especially those built on iOS, Apple’s operating system for mobile devices, no longer follow the well-known, well-established principles of design that Apple developed several decades ago. These principles, based on experimental science as well as common sense, opened up the power of computing to several generations, establishing Apple’s well-deserved reputation for understandability and ease of use. Alas, Apple has abandoned many of these principles. True, Apple’s design guidelines for developers for both iOS and the Mac OS X still pay token homage to the principles, but, inside Apple, many of the principles are no longer practiced at all. Apple has lost its way, driven by concern for style and appearance at the expense of understandability and usage.
苹果公司的产品，尤其是那些建立在苹果公司为移动设备开发的iOS系统上的产品，已经不再遵守自己几十年前发展起来的众所周知，十分成熟的设计原则，这些设计原则基于实验科学和常识，把计算能力提高了几代，建立了苹果产品名不虚传的可理解性和易用性。可惜的是，苹果公司已经放弃了很多这些原则。诚然，苹果给iOS和Mac OS X开发者的设计指导方针仍然对这些原则表示敬意，但是在苹果公司内部，许多这些原则不再实行。苹果已经迷失了方向，被风格和外观所驱使，以可理解性和易用性为代价。

Apple is destroying design.
苹果正在毁灭设计。

Apple is destroying design. Worse, it is revitalizing the old belief that design is only about making things look pretty. No, not so! Design is a way of thinking, of determining people’s true, underlying needs, and then delivering products and services that help them. Design combines an understanding of people, technology, society, and business. The production of beautiful objects is only one small component of modern design: Designers today work on such problems as the design of cities, of transportation systems, of health care. Apple is reinforcing the old, discredited idea that the designer’s sole job is to make things beautiful, even at the expense of providing the right functions, aiding understandability, and ensuring ease of use.
苹果正在毁灭设计。更糟糕的是，它使设计出只要外形漂亮的物品这种老旧的的理念重新燃起。不，不能这样！设计是思考的一种方式，决定于人们真实的，潜在的需要，然后给人们提供带来帮助的产品和服务。设计包含一个人对科技、社会和商业的理解。制作外形美观的物体只是现代设计的一小部分：当今的设计师们就城市交通系统，卫生保健系统的设计进行研究。苹果公司加强陈旧的，不足以使人信服的理念，即设计者的唯一工作要求就是使物品造型更加美观，甚至以提供正确合适的功能、增强可理解性和确保方便使用产品为代价。

#### Apple, you used to be the leader. Why are you now so self-absorbed? Worse, why does Google follow all your worst examples?
#### 苹果，你曾经是行业的领导者。为什么你如今变得如此自闭？更糟糕的是，为什么谷歌遵循你最坏的例子？

Yes, once upon a time, Apple was known for its ease of use, for computers and applications that were understandable, powerful, and could be used without reference to any manuals. All the operations were discoverable (the power of menus), all could be undone or redone, and there was considerable feedback so you always knew what had just taken place. Users were encouraged to blossom, with greater and greater power being revealed as users became ready. Apple’s design guidelines and their principles were powerful, popular, and influential.
是的，曾几何时，苹果的计算机和应用程序便捷实用，容易理解且功能强大，不需要任何参考手册便可使用，苹果因此闻名。所有的操作都可以被发现（菜单的功能），都可以撤销或重做，并且有相当多的反馈，所以你总是能知道刚刚所发生的一切。用户被鼓励扩散，随着用户们的扩散越来越多的功能被显现出来。苹果的设计指导思想和原则是强大的，流行的和有影响力的。

However, when Apple moved to gestural-based interfaces with the first iPhone, followed by its tablets, it deliberately and consciously threw out many of the key Apple principles. No more discoverability, no more recoverability, just the barest remnants of feedback. Why? Not because this was to be a gestural interface, but because Apple simultaneously made a radical move toward visual simplicity and elegance at the expense of learnability, usability, and productivity. They began shipping systems that people have difficulty learning and using, getting away with it because people don’t recognize such problems until it is too late, and money has already changed hands. Even then, people tend to blame themselves for the shortcomings of their devices: "If I weren’t so stupid . . . !"
然而，在苹果第一部基于手势界面的手机问世之后，紧接着发布了平板电脑。这次苹果故意抛弃了许多关键的原则。没有了可发现性，没有了可恢复性，仅仅残存着反馈。为什么？不是因为这是个手势交互，而是因为苹果同时做了个激进的行动，为了达到视觉的简约和优雅，以可学习性，可用性和效率为代价。他们开始了出货系统，然而对于新产品人们在学习和使用上遇到了困难，人们开始渐渐远离它，当人们意识到这些问题时已经为时已晚，钱已经被苹果赚去了。即使到这个时候，人们还倾向于责备他们自己：“如果我不那么笨就好了...!”，其实这些本来就是设备的缺点。

Today’s iPhones and iPads are a study in visual simplicity. Beautiful fonts. A clean appearance, uncluttered by extraneous words, symbols, or menus. So what if many people can't read the text? It’s beautiful.
今天的 iPhones 和 iPads 都在简洁视觉上做文章。优美的字体，清爽的外表，外来词，标志或是菜单都是整洁的。然后很多人不能读这些文章，它又有什么用呢？它仅仅美丽而已。

A woman told one of us that she had to use Apple’s assistive tool to make Apple’s undersize fonts large and contrasty enough to be readable. However, she complained that on many app screens, this option made normal fonts so large that the text wouldn’t fit on the screen. It’s important to note that she did not have defective vision. She just didn’t have the eyesight of a 17-year-old. We suspect she would have been perfectly able to read the same text before Apple switched to type fonts with thinner stroke widths and less visual contrast.
一位女士告诉我们她不得不使用苹果的辅助工具使苹果的小号字体变大能够阅读。然而，她抱怨说在许多软件的屏幕上，这种选择使正常字体变大以至于文本无法适应屏幕。重要的是她没有视力缺陷。她只是没有17岁时的视力，我们猜在苹果把字体宽度变得更薄，对比度更低以前，这位女士可以完美地阅读相同的文本。

What kind of design philosophy requires millions of its users to have to pretend they are disabled in order to be able to use the product? Apple could have designed its phone so that the majority of people could read and use the phone without having to label themselves as needy, disabled, and requiring assistance. Even worse, the assistive corrections destroy the very beauty Apple is so fond of as well as sometimes making the text no longer fit on the screen. If the font would have had slightly greater width, higher contrast, and with just a bit less antialiasing, all well understood principles of font design for readability. Apple could have preserved both beauty and legibility.
什么样的设计理念，需要数以百万计的用户不得不假装自己是残疾的，以便能够使用该产品？苹果可能这样设计了自己的手机，使大多数人能够阅读和使用手机，而不必把自己标注为贫困，残疾和需要援助的人。更糟的是，辅助修正破坏了苹果自己很忠爱的美感，并且有时会使得文本不再适合在屏幕上显示。

The legibility of the text is only one of Apple’s many design failures. Today’s devices lack discoverability: There is no way to discover what operations are possible just by looking at the screen. Do you swipe left or right, up or down, with one finger, two, or even as many as five? Do you swipe or tap, and if you tap is it a single tap or double? Is that text on the screen really text or is it a critically important button disguised as text? So often, the user has to try touching everything on the screen just to find out what are actually touchable objects.
文本的可读性只是苹果公司的许多失败设计之一。今天的设备缺乏可发现：仅仅看着屏幕是无法知道哪些是可能的操作。你是否用一根手指，两个甚至多达五个向左或向右滑动，向上或向下滑动？你是否滑动或者点击？如果是点击的话，它是单击还是双击？屏幕上的文本真的是文本还是伪装成文本的一个极为重要的按钮？所以很多时候，用户尝试触摸屏幕上的所有东西只是为了找出什么是真正可触的对象。

Another problem is the inability to recover after an undesired action. One way to do that is with undo, the addition of which to the original graphical user interfaces was brilliant. Not only did it allow for recovery from most actions, it gave users the freedom to try new actions, confident of their ability to recover if the result was not to their liking. Alas, Apple, in moving to iOS, initially discarded this essential element of system design, perhaps because undo would require an object on the screen in order to invoke it. This would detract from the clean elegance Apple now prefers over clear understanding and usability.
另一个问题是无法恢复不期望的操作。一个方法是撤销，这是以前图形用户交互聪明的做法。它不仅允许恢复大部分动作，而且使用户能够自由地尝试新动作，当结果与他们期望不同时，他们自己能够恢复到上级操作。可惜的是，苹果发展到iOS以后，开始抛弃系统设计的基本要素-撤销，也许是因为撤消操作要求屏幕上有个撤销对象。对于现在更喜欢简洁优雅而不是简单易用性的苹果来说，这有损于自己的形象。

Out went undo. So guess what happened? People complained. En masse. So they put undo back in, sort of: All you have to do to undo is to violently shake your phone or tablet. But undo is not universally implemented, and there is no way to know except by shaking. And even then you don't know if you didn't shake properly or if undo was not implemented for that particular situation.
撤销操作被取消了。所以你猜发生了什么？人们开始集体抱怨了。因此他们用另一种方式把撤销放回来了：通过剧烈摇晃手机或者平板电脑来撤销。但撤消并没有得到普遍的使用，而且除了摇晃没有其他方法知道撤销的存在。甚至如果你摇的方式不对或者某个特定的环境下没有撤销操作，你也发现不了撤销操作的存在。

Touch-sensitive screens, especially on relatively small devices, offer multiple opportunities for things to go wrong when an active link or button is accidentally touched. These accidental touches move the user to a new destination. The standard, simple way of correcting for these occasional mis-touches is to have a Back control: Android phones have Back built into the phone as a universal control that is always available. Apple does not. Why? We don’t know. Were they trying to avoid having a button or a menu? The result does provide for a clean, elegant visual appearance, but the simple-appearance mask is deceptive, for it increases the difficulty of usage.
尤其在相对较小的设备上，触摸屏更容易出现误操作，例如无意点击了一个链接或按了一个按钮。这些无意的触碰把用户带到了新的页面。简单标准的校正这些偶尔误触摸的方法就是放置一个返回键：Android手机已经把返回键作为了一个通用控制，并且返回键总是可用。苹果却没有这么做。 为什么？我们不知道。他们在试图避免弄一个按钮或菜单吗？结果是苹果的做法确实获得了一个干净，优雅的外观，但是简单的外观是骗人的，因为这增加了使用的难度。

Apple does provides a "back" arrow in some locations, but, unlike Google’s Android, where it is universally available, Apple’s undo and back buttons are at the option of the developer. Not everyone, including Apple, implements these features.
在某些位置苹果确实提供了返回箭头，但是与谷歌 Android 却不一样的，Android 上的返回键到处都有，然而苹果的撤销和返回键由开发者来选择。并不是所有人能实现这些功能，也包括苹果。

In the absence of any signals on the screen (what Norman calls "signifiers"), how is a person to know whether to swipe up or down, left or right, use one finger or two or three or four or five, or tap once, twice, or three times, or tap long or short? Users must memorize these gestures after first being told, "read the manual" (what manual?) or discovering them by accident.
在没有任何信号的屏幕上（诺曼称之为“标志”），人们是如何知道该向上还是向下滑动，向左还是向右，用一个手指还是两个，三个，四个亦或是五个手指，是单击还是双击亦或是三击，长按还是短按？在知道这些手势后，用户必须得记住这些手势，“阅读手册“（什么手册？）或者无意中发现这些手势操作。

The product is beautiful! And fun. As a result, when people have difficulties, they blame themselves. Good for Apple. Bad for the customer. Someone should write a book about this. (Oh, wait, both of us have—[several](http://www.jnd.org/books.html) [books](http://www.nngroup.com/people/bruce-tognazzini/).)
苹果产品是如此地漂亮！结果有趣的是，当人们在使用上遇到困难的时候，他们只是责备自己。这样一来对苹果来说是好事，却对消费者不利。有人应该写一本关于这个的书。（哦，等等，这里就有两本）

Good design should be attractive, pleasurable, and wonderful to use. But the wonderfulness of use requires that the device be understandable and forgiving. It must follow the basic psychological principles that give rise to a feeling of understanding, of control, of pleasure. These include discoverability, feedback, proper mapping, appropriate use of constraints, and, of course, the power to undo one’s operations. These are all principles we teach elementary students of interaction design. If Apple were taking the class, it would fail.
好的设计应该是具有吸引力的，令人愉快的，用起来很棒的。但是用起来很棒要求设备容易理解和具有宽容性。好的设计应该遵守基本的心理原则：由理解到控制，然后上升到愉悦。这些原则包括可发现性，反馈，适当的映射，适当的使用限制，当然还有权力撤销某个操作。这些原则都是我们教给那些初步学习交互设计的学生的。如果苹果公司来修这门课，将会是不及格。

Worse, other companies have followed in Apple’s path, equating design with appearance while forgetting the fundamental principles of good design. As a result, programmers rush to code without understanding the people who will use the products. Designers focus entirely on making it all look pretty. And executives get rid of user experience teams who want to help design the products properly and ensure the products are made usable during the design phase, not after manufacturing, coding, and release, when it is too late. These uninformed company executives assume all this up-front design research, prototyping, and testing clearly must slow down the development process. Nope. When done properly, it speeds things up by catching problems early, before coding even begins.
更糟糕的是，其他公司都遵循苹果的道路，只注重了外观设计，却忘记了好设计的基本原则。结果，程序员急于完成代码，而不去了解即将使用该产品人。设计师完全集中注意力于使产品看起来漂亮。主管们摆脱了用户体验团队，那些想帮助设计正确产品和确保产品在设计阶段可用的人，以免在制作，编码和发布后才发现问题，那时已经为时已晚。这些公司高管认为前期设计研究，原型和测试必将放慢开发进程。非也！如果处理得当，而且因为这是在早期捕捉问题，甚至在编码开始前就捕捉到问题，相反却可以提高开发速度。

Apple products deliberately hide complexity by obscuring or removing important controls.
苹果产品通过模糊或者删除重要的控件来隐藏自己的复杂性。

The result of avoiding proper design methodology? Higher costs for service lines, for help. And the eventual defection of unhappy customers who may publicly still sing the praises of Apple’s simple interface while forking over the money for a different brand phone that they hope they’ll be smart enough to actually be able to use.
避免正确设计方法的结果是什么呢？是更高的售后成本。不高兴的消费者逐渐叛逃，他们可能仍然赞美苹果的简约界面，但他们会花钱买一个不同品牌的手机，他们希望这些手机实际使用起来能够足够智能。

Please don’t tell us stories of grandparents who can now use technological devices such as tablets whereas before they could never master computers. Just how much of the new technology have they mastered? Yes, gesture-controlled devices, tablets, and phones have easier barriers to initial use. But they have huge barriers to anything advanced, such as selecting three photos to send in an email, or formatting some text, or combining the results of several different operations. These and myriad other operations are far easier and more efficient on traditional computers.
请不要告诉我们不会使用电脑的爷爷奶奶现在却可以使用像平板电脑之类的科技设备。那么他们究竟掌握了多少新科技呢？是的，像平板电脑和手机等手势控制的设备，这些设备初次使用很简单。但是对于任何高级的操作，他们却有巨大的学习障碍，例如用电子邮件发三张照片，格式化文本，或者组合几个不同操作的结果。这些操作和很多其它操作一样可以在传统计算机上更简单高效地完成。

#### More Attractive And More Difficult To Use
#### 更具吸引力，更难以使用

The new generation of software has made gigantic leaps forward in attractiveness and computational power while simultaneously getting harder for people to use.
新一代的软件在吸引力和计算能力上取得了巨大的飞跃，可是同时也变得更加难用。

The problem is not restricted to Apple. Google maps become more attractive and more confusing with each iteration. Same with the Android operating system. Microsoft’s Windows 8 is actually a clever and intelligent design for gestural devices, solving many of the problems we have just described, but fails to integrate the different operation style required of desktop machines that are intended for productive work. (Microsoft has recognized the problem, and the introduction of Windows 10—skipping over 9—is meant to overcome these issues: We do not yet have enough experience with the product to form any opinion.)
不仅仅苹果有这个问题。谷歌地图在迭代的同时变得更有吸引力，也更令人困惑。安卓操作系统也是如此。对于手势操作设备而言，微软的 Windows 8实际上是个聪明智慧的设计，解决了许多我们刚才所描述的问题，但未能将桌面计算机所需的不同操作方式集成用于生产工作。（微软已经意识到这个问题了，跳过了Windows 9，在Windows 10的介绍中，已经明确克服这些问题：我们还没有足够的产品经验来达成任何意见。）

Why the problem? Because design comes in many flavors, just as every discipline has multiple flavors. In software, a driver programmer is not necessarily any good at interaction programming, nor is the kernel developer good at telecommunication programming. In the design arena, interaction designers trained in psychology know the principles of conceptual models, clarity, and understandability, while those trained in computer science may not, and those from the graphic design field seem to think that interaction design means websites, and they often fail to understand either programming niceties or human-computer interaction.
为什么存在这个问题？因为设计有许多分类，就像每门学科有多个方向。在软件开发中，驱动程序程序员不需要擅长交互编程，内核开发者也不需要擅长通信编程。在设计领域，学过心理学的交互设计师知道概念模型，清晰度和可理解性的原则，然而学习计算机科学的这些人却不知道这些原则，甚至那些从事图形设计领域的人似乎还认为交互设计就是网站，他们常常既无法理解编程细节，也无法理解人机交互。

It matters. It matters when people end up thinking they are stupid because they can’t seem to use an interface that has been made to seem perfectly clear even though it isn’t. It matters that our leading products are going backward in both usability and usefulness.
这个问题影响很大。它影响到当人们无法使用好看起来非常完美但实际上并不完美的交互界面的话，他们会觉得自己愚蠢。它使我们的主流产品在可用性和实用性上都倒退了。

#### What Went Wrong?
#### 什么地方出错了？

One of us, Tognazzini, worked at Apple with Steve Jobs in the early days. Norman joined Apple shortly after Jobs departed and then left shortly after Jobs returned in 1996\. We were not present during the shift from the days of easy-to-use, easy-to-understand products (where Apple could honestly brag that no manual was necessary), to today’s products where no manual is included, but is often necessary. We do know that before Jobs returned, Apple had a three-pronged approach to product design: user experience, engineering, and marketing, with all three taking part in the design cycle from day one to when the product shipped.
Tognazzini是我们当中的一人，在创业初期曾在苹果和 Steve Jobs 一起工作。在 Steve Jobs 离开公司不久 Norman 加入了苹果，1996年 Steve Jobs 重返苹果，之后不久 Norman 离开了苹果。我们没能见证从苹果是易于使用，易于理解的产品（当时苹果可以吹嘘有必要无人操作）到今天无人操作，但是又离不开人的转变。我们知道的是在 Jobs 返回公司之前，苹果有一个三管齐下的产品设计方法：用户体验，设计和营销，从设计周期开始的第一天到产品发货，这三个方法都参与其中。

Today’s Apple has eliminated the emphasis on making products understandable and usable, and instead has imposed a Bauhaus minimalist design ethic on its products.
现如今苹果已经对产品可理解性和易用性不再重视了，取而代之的是对产品实行 Bauhaus 简约设计风格。

Unfortunately, visually simple appearance does not result in ease of use, as the vast literature in academic journals on human-computer interaction and human factors demonstrates.
不幸的是，视觉上的直观简洁不会使产品变得易用，人机交互和人为因素学术期刊的大量文献给出了证明。

Apple products deliberately hide complexity by obscuring or even removing important controls. As we often like to point out, the ultimate in simplicity is a one-button controller: very simple, but because it has only a single button, its power is very limited unless the system has modes. Modes require a control to take on different meanings at different times, leading to confusion and errors. Alternatively, a single control can have obscure ways of working, so that a button (or touchscreen) would invoke different operations if tapped once, twice, or thrice, or if touched with one, two, or three fingers, or moved up or down, left or right. Or perhaps with a special number of fingers, a special number of times, in a special direction: Just open up the Apple "System Preferences" control panel on a Macintosh and read the choices (and differences) between the meaning of taps and gestures on the Apple mouse or the trackpad.
苹果的产品故意遮蔽甚至删除重要的控制来隐藏复杂性。正如我们经常想指出的，极致简约是一种一键式控制：非常简单，但是因为只有一个按钮，它的功能是非常有限的，除非系统有模式。模式需要一个相同的控制操作在不同的时间有不同的含义，这将导致混淆和错误。另外，单一的控制可以有好几种工作方式，所以按钮（或者触摸屏）如果单击，双击，或者点击三次，亦或是用一根，两根，三根手指触摸屏幕，上下或者左右滑动屏幕，将会调用不同的操作。或许用特定个数的手指，用特定的次数，沿特定的方向：只需在 Macintosh 上打开苹果控制面板上的“系统偏好设置”然后阅读苹果鼠标或触控板的点击和手势意义之间的选择（和差异）。

Simple appearance can make control more difficult, more arbitrary, require memorization, and be subject to multiple forms of error. In fact, in the early days of Apple’s Lisa and Macintosh computers, "No Modes" was a rallying cry. The only way to have no modes is to have dedicated controls, each always meaning the very same thing.
简洁的外观可以使控制更加困难，更加随心所欲，需要记忆，并且容易犯多种形式的错误。事实上，在苹果 Lisa 和 Macintosh 电脑的初期，“无模式”是振臂一呼。没有模式的唯一方法是有专门的控制，并且每个控制都意味着同样的事情。

The principle of modes and the tradeoff between the appearance of simplicity and actual simplicity in action are taught in elementary interaction design courses. Why has Apple abandoned this knowledge?
模式的原理和简洁外观与实际的简单性之间的权衡在基本交互设计课程中有讲过。为什么苹果公司放弃了这个知识？

#### Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines
#### 苹果的人机界面指南

All modern computer companies produce Human Interface Guidelines for their developers. Apple was the first to have such a guide, and it served as a wonderful text for principles of good, understandable design. The earliest edition of the Apple Human Interface Guidelines was written in 1978 by Tognazzini. By the 1987 edition, written in 1985-'86, every key principle of modern interfaces had been incorporated. They were still in force in 1996 when Steve Jobs returned.
所有现代计算机公司都为他们的开发者出品人机界面指南。苹果是第一个有这样的指导，并且它为良好的，容易理解的设计提供了原则。苹果人机界面指南最早版本由Tognazzini在1978年编写。到了1987年版，写于1985-1986之间，已经纳入了现代接口关键原则。在1996年史蒂夫·乔布斯回来时，这些原则仍然生效。

That full set of Apple’s principles was the result of a project Tognazzini put together at Apple to extract the principles from the Mac interface. Prior to this, the principles were known only implicitly by the people working on graphical user interfaces. Writing them down made them explicit, thereby easing the task of training new employees and the ever-increasing number of developers of products for the Macintosh.
苹果公司的全套原则是 Tognazzini 从 Mac 界面总结的原则。在此之前，这些原则只由图形用户界面的工作者隐性掌握。写下这些原则使他们明确了，从而缓解对新员工培训和越来越多为 Macintosh 开发产品的任务。

![](http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-xlarge/inline/2015/11/3053406-inline-5-how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name.jpg)

In extracting the principles, the team relied heavily on the research done by the just-forming human-computer interaction (HCI) community and, specifically, the work of Norman and his students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), published in papers for the HCI conferences in the early 1980s and in the book edited by Norman and Draper (1986), _User Centered System Design_ (UCSD). (Several of the early developers of the Macintosh computer and the people working on Apple’s extraction process had been among the students in Norman’s classes.)
在抽取原则时，团队主要依靠 HCI 社区做的研究，具体而言，在19世纪80年代早期，诺曼和他的学生在加州大学圣地亚哥分校的工作在HCI会议上发表了，并且在由诺曼和德雷珀主编的书《User Centered System Design》中也发表了。（几个 Macintosh 计算机的早期开发者和参与苹果的提取过程的人，一直在诺曼的班上学习。）

It’s important to note that these principles reflect the needs, desires, and abilities of human beings, not the machines they use. The principles are as applicable to today’s interfaces as those of the 1980s, and they will remain applicable until people evolve, a rather slow process indeed.
要注意的是，这些原则反映了人们的需求，意愿和人类的能力，而不是他们使用的机器。这些原则不仅适用于19世纪80年代，也适用于今天的接口交互，并且这些原则将一直适用，直到人类进化。这实际上是一个很漫长的过程。

The [current Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1) for developers do set forth numerous and relevant design principles, but the emphasis is clearly on appearance, in particular the appearance of simplicity, along with user pleasure and enjoyment. These are important attributes, but hardly sufficient.
目前苹果iOS人机界面开发者指南的确提出了众多相关的设计原则，但重点显然是在外观，尤其是外观简洁，还有用户的愉悦和享受。这些都是重要的属性，但是很不充分。

In particular, the Guidelines admonish developers no fewer than 14 times to make sure their visual communication is subtle. Sure, designs should be kept as clean and as simple as possible, but not by removing necessary signifiers. How does a designer find out whether or not they are necessary? The only known way is through testing users. What do the Guidelines have to say about usability testing?
具体而言，开发者指南不少于14次告诫开发者要确保微妙的视觉传达。当然，设计应保持干净，并尽可能简单，但不能去除必要的能指。设计师如何知道这些东西是否是必要的？唯一已知的方法是测试用户。

It’s a really good idea.
这真是一个好主意。

No, it’s a mandatory idea. And you do it with subjects that are representative of your expected users, not, as Apple suggests, by testing . . . a few colleagues.
不，这是一个强制性的想法。参与测试的并不是你所期望的用户，而是他们的代表，啊不，如苹果暗示的，仅仅是几个同事。

#### Apple Threw Away The Good In The Quest For Visual Simplicity
#### 苹果在追求视觉简洁中丢掉了西瓜

The original principles for Apple’s design stressed the importance of making systems understandable, easy to learn without manuals, and functional. Somewhere along the line, Apple lost track of the key principles that it used to follow. Figure 1 shows the changes that took place over time (prepared for us by the industrial designer Michael Meyer, who, after reading an early version of this paper, put together the diagram and gave us permission to use it). Meyer’s figure traces the changes in core principles of Apple’s guidelines over time.
最初的苹果设计原则强调使系统容易理解的重要性，简单易学，不用手册。在前进的路上，苹果丢失了过去自己遵循的重要原则。图一展示了随时间发生的变化（由工业设计师迈克尔·迈耶为我们准备的，他读了本文的一个早期版本后，收集了这些图并允许我们使用）迈耶的图片追溯了苹果开发者指南核心原则随时间的变化。

See and Point disappeared from the iOS Guidelines in late 2010, when moving to iOS 4.
See and Point在2010年年底从iOS指南中消失的，当时系统正升级到iOS 4。

While probably an artifact of changing to an alphabetical listing (previous lists had an implied hierarchy to the principles), the 2015 iOS listing implies that Aesthetic Integrity jumps to the top, and Metaphors and User Control fall to the bottom.
尽管更改为按字母顺序排列可能是一个假象（以往的名单有一个隐含的层次结构原则），2015年的iOS意味着审美完整性跳到了顶部，Metaphors和User Control下降到了谷底。

#### The Missing Principles
#### 失踪的原则

The most important principles largely or completely missing in iOS are discoverability, feedback, recovery, consistency, and the encouragement of growth:
iOS中大部分或者全部丢失的重要原则是：可发现性，反馈，可恢复性，一致性和成长鼓励：

### Discoverability
### 可发现性

Discoverability, the ability to look at the system and immediately discover all the possible actions, was always a key component to the success of Apple designs. The principle was called "see and point" in the early days (and in Figure 1) because all possible actions were represented by objects such as buttons, icons, or menu list items that were visible to the user: See the action you want to do, point the mouse cursor at it, and one click delivered it. Simply put, discoverability means making actions discoverable—visible—so that they do not have to be memorized. The menus in the traditional desktop computers served this purpose well. Labeled icons do as well. Unlabeled icons most often fail, but the worst culprit of all is the complete lack of any cue. Note that discoverability no longer appears in the Apple Guidelines.
可发现性，即看一眼系统立马发现所有可能操作的能力，一直是苹果设计成功的一个关键组成部分。在早期这个原则叫做“see and point”（在图1），因为所有可能的操作都由用户看得见的对象替代了，例如按钮，图标或菜单列表项：找到你想要的操作，把鼠标光标放上去，然后点击执行。简单地说，发现性意味着使操作视觉上可发现，这样就不用把这些操作记下来。传统电脑桌面的菜单很好地体现了这个目的，标记的图标同样是的。未标记的图标经常失败，但最糟糕的罪魁祸首是完全没有任何线索。请注意苹果的指导手册里再也没有可发现性了。

### Feedback
### 反馈

Feedback and its partner, feedforward, allow a person to know what happened after an action was done (feedback) or to understand what will happen if the action is selected (feedforward).
反馈和前馈能让人知道一个操作完成后会发生什么（反馈）或者选择该操作后会发生什么（前馈）。

People depend on a steady stream of feedback to know how effective their actions have been. In the physical world, feedback is automatic. In the world of software, feedback occurs only if the designer has thought about it. Without feedback, people can be unsure of the current state: They will neither be in charge nor feel in charge.
人们依赖于源源不断的反馈来知道他们的操作是否有效。在物理世界中，反馈是自动的。在软件世界中，只有设计者考虑到反馈才会有反馈。如果没有反馈，人们无法确定当前状态：他们既不掌控也感觉不到掌控。

### Recovery
### 可恢复性

Errors happen. Recovery dictates it should be as easy or easier to undo than to do. (Called "forgiveness" in the guidelines and Figure 1, it too has disappeared from the current guidelines.) Recovery was implemented with the command "undo." Undo originated in 1974 at the (then) Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), probably by Warren Teitelman. The Apple Lisa and Macintosh, as is well known, derived their basic structures from the early development work at PARC (Apple purchased the rights from Xerox). The Undo command can itself be undone by means of "Redo." Undo and redo provide a powerful method both of recovering from errors but also of experimenting, trying things out, knowing that test operations can always be undone or redone.
错误发生时，恢复不会比重做难。（在指南和图1中叫做“forgiveness”，这也从当前的指南中消失了。）恢复是用“撤销”命令来实现的。撤消起源于1974年（当时的）施乐公司的帕洛阿尔托研究中心（PARC），可能是由Warren Teitelman提出。众所周知的苹果Lisa和Macintosh,他们的基本机构是由在PARC（苹果从富士施乐购买的版权）的早期开发工作得来的。撤销命令可以通过“重做”命令撤销。撤消和重做提供了从错误中恢复的一个有效的方法，但是也可以用来尝试，知道测试的操作可以随时撤销或重做。

Undo enables a user to recover content. Back is a companion command that enables a user to recover the user’s previous location in a navigational system. The original graphical user interfaces eliminated the user’s need to back up by eliminating navigation. Instead, documents and tools are brought to the user. Browsers and iOS are a throwback to the earlier navigational interfaces, where users wander about a labyrinth of passages leading to modal screens.
撤销使用户能够恢复内容。返回是一个同伴命令，使用户返回到之前在导航系统中的位置。原始的图形用户界面通过关闭导航来结束，然后把文档和工具呈现给用户。浏览器和iOS是一个倒退到以前的导航界面，用户在迷宫一样的通向模态屏幕的通道中彷徨。

Browsers, in supporting the navigational system called the web, provide a Back button so users can move backward in their journey. IOS provides no such generalized tool, so that, for example, if you accidentally fire off a link from inside an app that takes you to Safari or YouTube or any one of many, many other places, there is no straightforward means of recovery. Back and Forward should be standard buttons in iOS so that the interface is forgiving of accidental navigation, instead of punitive.
浏览器在支持导航的系统中叫网络，提供了返回按钮，使用户能够在他们的旅程中向后移动。iOS没有提供这样的通用工具，所以假如你不小心在一个应用程序中点击了一个链接，指向Safari或YouTube或者众多地方之一，是没有直接恢复方法的。后退和前进应该是iOS的标准按钮，这样界面对意外导航具有宽容性而不是惩罚性。

### Consistency
### 一致性

Most technology users have more than one device, yet the operations of the different devices often clash. Even within the same device, Apple has violated consistency: Rotate the iPhone, and keyboards change their layouts; rotate an iPad, and the home screen icons reorder themselves, with no simple way to predict where an icon will end up.
大多数技术用户拥有多个设备，但不同设备的操作常常发生冲突。即使在同一台设备，苹果也违背了一致性：旋转iPhone，键盘会改变布局；旋转iPad，主屏幕图标会重新排序，没有简单的方法预测图标会跑到哪里。

Consistency is still listed in the guidelines—but it is not followed. The Magic Mouse works differently than the track pad, which is different than gestures on the iPhone or tablet. Why? (Such inconsistencies can usually be traced to designers working away in isolation, never talking with one another. As Conway [](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name?utm_source=digg), the products of a company reflect the organizational structure of the company.)
一致性仍然列在指南中，不过已经不遵循了。魔术鼠标的工作原理不同于触控板，这好比手势在iPhone或平板电脑上不同。为什么？（这种不一致通常可以归咎于设计者的封闭工作，从不与他人讨论。例如康威，一个公司的产品反映了公司的组织结构。）

### Encourage Growth
### 成长鼓励

Good design encourages people to learn and grow, taking on new and more complex tasks once they’ve learned the basics. Snapshot takers grow to become photographers, personal journal writers become bloggers, and children try programming and end up seeking careers in computer science. For decades, encouraging learning and growth was the life blood of Apple, a principle so important that it was universally internalized and understood.
良好的设计鼓励人们学习和成长，一旦他们已经学会了基础知识，就接受新的更复杂的任务。快照者成长为摄影师，一人日记作家成为博客作者，孩子尝试编程，并最终寻求计算机科学的职业生涯。几十年来，鼓励学习和成长是苹果的命脉，这是一个重要的原则，被普遍内化和理解。

ABISAG TÜLLMANN



#### Dieter Rams And The Minimalists’ Rationalization
#### 迪特·拉姆斯和极简主义的合理化

Many of the worst of Apple’s hidden principles are often excused by claiming that Apple is only following [the teachings of the famous German designer Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design), who for many years was responsible for the beauty and understandability of the products of the German company Braun. They specifically cite Rams’s 10th Principle: "Good design is as little design as possible" (Vitsoe, 2015). But note that this is his 10th Principle, not his 1st. It might be rewritten as, "If you’ve followed the first nine principles, well, it’s time to stop. Don’t start cluttering things up." Apple, however, has violated many of those earlier principles. Here are all 10 principles of good design:
许多苹果最糟糕的隐藏原则常常被宣传苹果只是继承德国著名设计师迪特·拉姆斯的教导而被原谅，他多年来负责德国博朗公司的产品的美感和可理解性。他们特别举出拉姆斯的第十项原则：“好的设计是尽可能少设计”（Vitsoe，2015年）。但是请注意，这是他的第十项原则，而不是他的首要原则。它可能被改写为，“如果你已经遵循了前九条原则，那么是时间停下来了，别把东西塞满。”无论如何，苹果已经违反了许多早期的原则。这里是良好设计的全部10项原则：
1.  <span>Innovative</span>创新
2.  <span>Makes a product useful</span>使产品有用
3.  <span>Aesthetic</span>艺术的
4.  <span>Makes a product understandable</span>使产品可理解
5.  <span>Unobtrusive</span>不显眼
6.  <span>Honest</span>诚实
7.  <span>Long-lasting</span>持久的
8.  <span>Thorough down to the last detail</span>详尽
9.  <span>Environmentally friendly</span>环保
10.  <span>As little design as possible</span>尽可能少设计

It is useful to look at Dieter Rams’s descriptions of some of these rules:
来看看迪特·拉姆斯对于这些原则的部分描述，这是很有用的：

**2\. Makes a product useful**
**2\. 使产品有用**

A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.  
产品是买来使用的。它必须满足某些标准，不仅实用性，还有心理和美感。良好的设计强调产品而忽视任何可能从它减损的效用。

Usefulness is essential to Rams. Obscuring controls, eliminating vital functions such as Undo and Back, do not make a product useful. Quite the contrary.
对于拉姆斯来说实用性是必不可少。模糊控制，消除了重要的功能，如撤销和后退，不会使产品变得好用。事实恰恰相反。

**3\. Aesthetic**
**3\. 艺术的**

The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
产品的艺术特性对于它的易用性来说是不可或缺的，因为我们每天使用的产品会影响我们个人和福祉。但是，只有良好的执行对象是美丽的。

In his writings and talks, Rams made it clear that aesthetics was not simply restricted to the visual appearance: The objects had to be well-executed in every aspect of design in order to be aesthetically beautiful. As his 2nd Principle states, this includes function and psychological factors (such as understandability and usability).
在他的著作和讲座中，拉姆斯明确表示，美学不只是局限在视觉外观：这些对象必学在设计的各个方面都执行良好才能外型美观。正如他的第二条原则指出，这包括功能和心理因素（如可理解性和可用性）。

**4\. Makes a product understandable**
**4\. 使产品可理解**

It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
它阐明了产品的结构。更妙的是，它可以使产品的说话。充其量，它是不言自明的。

Although Apple’s design principles still do talk about the importance of understandability, the products do not reflect this property. Apple’s interfaces have invisible buttons and controls and, in general, a lack of aids for understanding.
虽然苹果的设计原则还在谈论可理解的重要性，可是产品却没反映出来这个特性。苹果的界面有无形的按钮和控制，在一般情况下，缺乏对于理解的帮助。

Consider the on-screen keyboard on the iPhone and iPad. The Apple keyboard shows the letters in upper case, no matter what is actually being typed. The only way of telling whether the keyboard will produce a capital or a lower case letter is to look at the keyboard’s up-pointing arrow, which is either black or white. Weird: First of all, this means that people have to recognize that the up-facing arrow is the control for upper/lowercase. Second, it means that they must know which color indicates which case. Quick—without looking at your Apple phone or iPad, which color do you think represents lowercase?
考虑iPhone和iPad上使用的屏幕键盘。苹果键盘显示的是大写字母，而不管你实际要打什么字母。分辨键盘大小写状态唯一方法是看键盘上的一个向上箭头，这个箭头既不是白色也不是黑色。很奇怪：首先，这意味着人们必须认识到这个向上的箭头是用来控制大小写的。第二，这意味着他们必须知道每种颜色对于的情况。在快速不看你的苹果手机或iPad情况下，你觉得哪种颜色代表小写？

Google’s Android screen keyboard shows the keyboard in uppercase when the letters will appear in uppercase, and in lowercase when the letters will appear in lowercase. See, it isn’t hard. Just think about how normal folks use the system.
谷歌的安卓屏幕键盘在大写状态下会显示大写，在小写状态下会消失小写。你看，这也不是很难。试想想一般人如何使用该系统。

But even where the guidelines are trying to enhance understanding, they try to minimize the use of informative material, what Norman calls "signifiers." (While Norman calls them signifiers, revealing his bias toward their communicative function, Apple calls them "decoration," revealing their own bias.)
但是，即使指南试图增强可理解性，他们试图尽量少用翔实的材料，即诺曼所说的“能指”（虽然诺曼称他们为能指，暴露了自己对他们交际功能的偏见，苹果称他们为“装饰”，暴露了自己的偏见。）

To signal interactivity, the built-in apps use a variety of cues, including color, location, context, and meaningful icons and labels. Users rarely need additional decorations to show them that an onscreen element is interactive or to suggest what it does.
对于信号交互，内置的应用程序使用各种线索，包括颜色，位置，上下文和有意义的图标与标签。用户很少需要额外的装饰，来显示屏幕上的元素是交互的或暗示它是什么。

The latest Human Interface Guidelines do try to remedy these issues. Moreover, Apple is now providing tools to ensure compliance. For example, our complaints about the legibility of fonts are being addressed. First, the guidelines now state: Above all, text must be legible. If users can’t read the words in your app, it doesn’t matter how beautiful the typography is.
最新的人机界面指南确实在尽力解决这些问题。此外，现在苹果提供工具来确保合规性。例如，我们对字体可读性的投诉正在处理。首先，现在的指南声明：文本必须清晰可辨。如果用户不能看清你的应用程序里的字的话，板式再漂亮也没有用。

Second, Apple provides a tool, "Dynamic Type," to do font changes properly without requiring the developer’s attention. The guidelines explain that Dynamic Type makes automatic adjustments to letter spacing and line heights, and responds appropriately "to changes the user makes to text-size settings (including accessibility text sizes)." It will take some time before we can tell if these changes are helping. Unfortunately, once a culture has been set, it is difficult to change, and Apple has deliberately made the culture into one that emphasizes visual appearance over understandability and usability.
其次，苹果提供了一个工具“动态式”，无需开发人员关注就能正确地改变字体。指南中解释说动态类型可以自动调整字间距和行高，并正确地响应用户对文字大小的设置（包括辅助文本大小）。我们需要一段时间才能知道这些变化是否有帮助。不幸的是，一旦一种文化被设定，就很难改变，苹果公司故意把文化侧重于视觉外观上的可理解性与易用性。

#### IOS 9

Passing critiques on a high-technology company with rapid product cycles is a challenge. Indeed, in Apple’s latest release of its mobile Operating System, iOS 9, a number of the issues we have discussed have been addressed. But this brings up two issues:
在一家拥有快速产品周期的高科技公司传递批评是一个挑战。事实上，在苹果发布的最新移动操作系统iOS9中，一些我们所讨论的问题已经得到解决。但是这又带来了两个问题：

**What took them so long?**  
**是什么让他们花这么长时间？**

If Apple were taking an elementary interaction design class, it would fail.
如果苹果去学习一门基础的交互设计课程，会是不及格。

For example, the design decision that when a keyboard is in uppercase mode, it should display uppercase letters and, when in lowercase mode, it should display lowercase letters, is so obvious that the failure to provide this simple feedback on the current mode defies all credulity. Well, this is not how it used to be at Apple: While it is finally correct in iOS 9, what took so long?
例如，设计决定当键盘处于大写状态，就应该显示大写字母，当处于小写状态，就应该显示小写字母，很明显，未能提供有关当前模式的简单反馈无视了所以的轻信。那么，这不是以前苹果的作风：虽然最终在iOS9中改正了，到底是什么花了这么长时间？

**The solutions Apple has adopted create yet more memory load on the poor users.**
**苹果已经采取的解决方案对低级用户创造了更多的内存负载。**

The headline of a _Forbes_ article says it all: "[Apple iOS 9 has 25 Great Secret Features](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/09/19/apple-ios-9-secrets/)." Secret features? If these are such great features, why are they secret? Why are they so difficult to get to? There are new ways to swipe: from the right, left, top, and down. From the center. With one, two, or more fingers. And in our experience, the same swiping motion with the same number of fingers seems to give different results at different places.
一篇福布斯文章的标题说明了一切："[苹果iOS 9的25个秘密功能](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/09/19/apple-ios-9-secrets/)." 秘密功能？如果这些是很强大的功能，为什么会是秘密的？他们为什么这么难以发现？有新的方法来滑动：从右，左，上，下或是中间。用一个，二哥或者更多的手指。在我们的经历中，用相同数量的手指和相同的滑动动作似乎在不同的地方会有不同的结果。

Apple: Please learn about the power of signifiers, visible indicators that help the poor, befuddled user. And make them unambiguous. Here is an example of what not to do: The icon for "rotation of the screen is locked" is either grayed or not. But is it locked when it is gray or when it is not gray? Turns out that Apple uses text to say which, but in tiny little letters somewhat removed from the icon itself. One of us, who spent five minutes searching for information on how to disable the lock, finally discovered the text—why does it take five minutes to learn what should be a frequent operation?
苹果：请了解能指和可见指标对低级迷茫用户的帮助，并且让他们明确。下面是一个不该做的例子：对于“屏幕的旋转被锁定”的图标可以是灰色或不是黑色。但是当它是灰色或者不是灰色时图标是锁定的吗？原来苹果使用文字来说明，但是是用很小的字体且不再图标上。我们当中的一个成员用了5分钟来寻找如何禁用锁定，最终发现了文本-那为什么还需要五分钟来学习一个频繁的操作？

#### The Problem And The Solution
#### 存在的问题及解决方案

Good user experience can only flow from a system where marketing, graphic and industrial design, engineering, and usability all work together in a collaborative effort to make life better, more enjoyable, and more productive for Apple’s customers.
良好的用户体验来自于市场营销、平面和工业设计、工程和可靠性共同作用的结果，使得生活更美好、愉悦，使苹果用户更富有出创造力。

Design is a complex field, with many separate subdisciplines. Industrial design is primarily concerned with materials and form, and this is the area in which Apple excels. Graphic design is supposed to be about aesthetics and communication, but Apple has emphasized appearance to the great detriment of the communication component.
设计是一个复杂的领域，有许多独立的分支学科。工业设计主要关注的是材料和形式，这是苹果公司擅长的领域。平面设计是关于美学和人机交流，但苹果公司强调外观不能损害通信组件。

Interaction design should emphasize discoverability, feedback, and the person’s ability to feel in control. Alas, the current interaction emphasizes the pleasurable emotional impact—which is important—at the expense of the understanding part, the part that lets people develop a good mental model of how the system works—which is at least equally important.
交互设计应强调可发现性、反馈和人的感觉控制的能力。当前交互强调愉悦情感的影响，认为这是重要的。为了了解这个部分，需要让人对这个系统如何工作养成一个良好的心理模式，这是是同样重要的。

Apple’s design process has become unbalanced. The Human Interface Guidelines address the imbalance, but are aimed at developers, and developers are not the problem. Apple is.
苹果的设计过程变得不平衡。用人机界面指南解决不平衡,是针对开发人员的，但开发人员都不是问题的根本。苹果才是问题的根本。

Today, people are forced to remember arbitrary gestures and placements. We never know whether something is permitted or not. When we accidentally touch the screen and the system takes us somewhere new, there is no way to back up and get to the earlier location—we most often have to start all over again. The designs appear to have discarded the science and Apple’s own experience in interaction design, an area in which Apple was once the leader.
今天,人们被迫记住任意手势。我们永远不会知道什么是允许的。当我们不小心触碰屏幕，系统把我们带到新的地方，但是没有办法备份或者回到早些的状态。这是我们不得不从头再来。设计似乎已经放弃了科学和苹果自己的交互设计经验，在这一领域苹果曾经是领头人。

Graphic and interaction designers have to work in equal partnership (along with industrial designers, engineers, and programmers). All design needs to be tested by trained professionals for both bugs and usability to see whether changes have helped or harmed.
图形和交互设计师在平等伙伴关系工作（和工业设计师，工程师和程序员一起）。所有的设计都需要由专业人员测试错误和可靠性，去看改变是否有益。

Beauty has come at a great price.
美丽是付出了巨大的代价换来的。

We conclude by summarizing the statements in Apple’s current guidelines, statements that are correct and appropriate and that convey the proper design philosophy.
最后，我们总结苹果公司目前正确且合适的指南和声明，传达了正确的设计理念。

**Deference.** The UI (user interface) helps people understand and interact with the content, but never competes with it.
**尊重.**UI(用户界面)帮助人们了解并与内容交互，但从不与之竞争。

**Clarity.** Text is legible at every size, icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate, and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design.
**明晰**文字在任何大小都清晰可辨，图标是精确和清晰的，装饰是细微且合适的，集中于功能开发将推动设计。

**Depth.** Visual layers and realistic motion impart vitality and heighten people’s delight and understanding.
**深度**视觉层次和真实的动作赋予活力和提高人们的喜悦与理解

And finally: Although crisp, beautiful UI and fluid motion are highlights of the iOS experience, the user’s content is at its heart—make sure that your designs elevate functionality and defer to the user’s content.
最后：虽然明快，美观的用户界面和流畅的动作都彰显出了iOS的用户体验，用户内容是iOS的核心，确保提升你的设计功能并满足用户内容。

Wonderful. Please, Apple, follow both the spirit and the letter of your own guidelines.
棒极了苹果！请遵循自己指南的灵魂，并落到实处！
