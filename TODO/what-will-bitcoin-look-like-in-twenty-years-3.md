# What Will Bitcoin Look Like in Twenty Years? - Part 3

### **8) We will have Four Dominate Meta Coins, Plus Fifty to One Hundred Minor Coins, and Infinite Virtual Variations of These Coins, Plus State Coins**

Right now we’re making coins for everything.

Got an identity platform like Civic? Make a coin.

Created decentralized DNS? Make a coin and ICO!

Building a scratch-your-ass on the blockchain app? You need a coin my friend!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*s70767X_wJBDhrgFEqf8ug.jpeg)

Actually you don’t need a coin.

Coins will start to shake out into various meta categories. At this point I can only see four types of coins needed, with a blockchain of blockchains (or post-blockchain tech) seamlessly swapping them as needed to consume services:

1.  **Deflationary Saver Coin**
2.  **Inflationary Spender Coin**
3.  **Action Token**
4.  **Reward Token**

Deflationary coins are for hoarding and investing. They will rise over time and benefit savers. Everyone needs this kind of investment and it’s the reason Bitcoin started in the first place.

An inflationary coin mirrors the dollar today. Nobody likes spending Bitcoin on a flat screen TV only to realize that they paid $175,000 for it a few years later as the price of Bitcoin rockets up. We need stable, spendable coins. Imagine this as the classic “store of value” Paul Krugman is always bitching about and know that we actually do need this to buy and sell every day goods.

An action token is for actions on the network that should always be free such as voting or sending a text message. These are _not_ microtransactions. Resetting my password on something should not cost the equivalent of two pennies. As the [**EOS**](https://eos.io/) folks say “If you went to Amazon and it cost three cents to load the page, nobody would load the page.”

Reward tokens are designed to flow around the system as a digital representation of karma, incentivizing good behavior and punishing bad behavior.

You could literally build the ultimate universal system with just these four coins. Every other coin could simply act as a subcomponent of those coins with different metadata.

### 9) We’ll Learn We Didn’t Know Crap About Economics

Are you a [Keynesian planner](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp) or an [Austrian free market](http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=Austrian-economics) adherent?

The answer is who cares?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*s70767X_wJBDhrgFEqf8ug.jpeg)

**All of our economic theories are based on studies conducting with limited data in the analog age of ink and wood pulp.** All current economic theory will prove about as advanced as cave paintings as we experiment with new economic systems over the coming years.

**That’s what these new coins are: Micro-economic systems at war.**

**It’s Darwinian economics.**

A few basic laws of economics will hold true but many of them will simply fall by the wayside. That’s because with blockchain dominate systems we’ll have real time economic data on a global scale not just a bunch of guesses done with pencil and paper a hundred years ago.

As artificial intelligence tracks statistics in real time around the globe we’ll be able to see the real effects of a steel tariff enacted in one country as prices shoot up for building in another country dependent on that steel. We’ll track global production and manufacturing with unbelievable precision and what we learn will very much surprise us in so many wonderful ways.

### 10) A DAO Will Grow to Fortune 500 Status

The most likely DAO to reach this milestone will be a DAO that mirrors an open version of Visa, in that it will likely take cuts from the transactions and miners on the most dominate network and it will help fund the future development and governance of that network.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*s70767X_wJBDhrgFEqf8ug.jpeg)

It will not hoard all the money but act as a nexus that flows the money down to other businesses and DAOs via smart contract as well as to state and local governments and other non-governmental entities that benefit the network.

To do that though the DAO has to evolve.

Right now we think of DAO’s as a smart contract. Not even close.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*sTyt0uLOyGvDk8gDe6LzCQ.jpeg)

“How beauteous mankind is! O **brave new world**, / That has such people in ‘t!”

A DAO will require AI to help manage and mitigate its rulesets and it will need to be able to auto-generate templated **governance models**. **Governance is everything in DAOs** and there are no good scalable models yet to manage a company the size of a major corporation today as an open source meritocratic workplace. Early DAOs failed because they have what I call the [**_Brave New World_**](http://amzn.to/2gNg6fk) problem.

**Everyone imagines they’re the chief and nobody wants to take out the trash.**

It’s hard to order paperclips when everyone is a king in a DAO.

**To function effectively a team needs role players _and_ stars.** People also have to understand their role and accept it, even if it will change later as they build merit and experience in the system.

Management is hard enough as it is in corporate environments. How do you fire someone for non-performance in a DAO? How do you ensure that the guy in charge of ICO security is actually qualified and not just elected because everyone likes him? You can’t risk someone running off with $45 million in Bitcoin because Bob got elected for his great stories about Burning Man and his painting skills.

The automated corporate and non-profit architectures of tomorrow will have to **evolve incredible tools for ongoing management and decision making as well as operating agreements that function like code to become a reality**.

### **11) The Gig Economy Will Grow Big Time**

People from the World War II generation had one or two jobs their whole life.

Today we have five or six.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*s70767X_wJBDhrgFEqf8ug.jpeg)

**Tomorrow’s people will have five or six at the same time.**

Half of those income streams will be automated and passive, likely some kind of crypto UBI. We will also see the rise of AI job matching services. The machines will know your capabilities and skill sets and match short term gigs to you so you don’t even have to look for a job.

Imagine a software project that requires an insane amount of code, something like ten trillion lines. Software projects are only getting more complicated and will continue to grow. AI’s will write and test half of it but people will write the other half. The project would get fed into a distributed, decentralized system that chunks up and parses out the work, acts like a project manager and delivers the work to coders all across the worldwide network based on the reputation and skillset fingerprint.

Think of it like an AI Github married to UpWork and the Mechanical Turk system.

It could work for manufacturing and all kinds of blue collar work as well, which can make a big dent in the haves and have-nots divide we see today.

The [Hong Kong subway AI](https://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-best-subway-system-is-powered-by-an-advanced-1601103048) is perhaps the first prototype of this kind of network, even if it’s not a perfect analogy. It predicts what will fail on the subway and sends engineers to get ahead of the failures. That makes the uptime of the world’s busiest subway 99%.

Much of this will be governed by Externalized [**Reputation Banks**](https://github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform/blob/master/Identity-Without-Authority-2017.21.3.BETA.pdf) powered by blockchains that will be the social credit of tomorrow.

This will be both good and very, very evil.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*dsM6oBVp5RrQIcS_c5lN6g.jpeg)

[Black Mirror’s Social Credit](http://amzn.to/2iNaIgc).

On the evil side of the house we have the [**Chinese Social Credit system**](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-score-like-black-mirror-2016-10) that is about as **_Black Mirror_** as it gets today. It will get infinitely worse as nation-states use Reputation Banks to cram ideology down people’s throats.

But open, publicly managed Rep Banks will help us find relationships and work and figure out who to trust in business and in life.

It will be a double edged sword.

The main challenge is that very few people can agree on what is good or bad in a system and ideology tends to warp those concepts into unrecognizable messes. It will be incredibly easy to create a ruleset that enslaves us all if we’re not careful.

### The Controversy Kings

I just cranked through some of the easier predictions to make. Now let’s toss out a few that just might spark fierce debates and controversy in the community.

### 12) The Blockchain Will Enable All Kinds of Evil

**Crypto enthusiasts will have to come to terms with the fact that the blockchain can and will enable as much evil as it does good.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*kwdBoz8WFuqp5Q61nQk5_g.jpeg)

Nothing is all good or evil. Everything exists on a continuum. You can kill someone with a gun but you can also feed your family by hunting. Water sustains life but it can also drown you or even [poison you](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1770067/).

If you’re out there designing a system right now with the “move fast and break things” DevOps approach, just know that it’s most likely a disaster for systems that can algorithmically govern many aspects of our lives.

**Instead, you should adopt a go slow, think about it and don’t break things approach.**

You should start thinking about all the ways to destroy your system or you won’t be able to defend it. If you aren’t imagining all the ways a hostile group will use the power of blockchain, one that doesn’t share your views on openness and freedom and collaboration, then you’re just naive.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*25H9XAhWfT7-wmrvQmC-Ug.gif)

I’m half way through an article called “**What If Hitler Had the Blockchain?**” Frankly, I don’t want to publish it because I don’t want to give the bad guys any fresh ideas but rest assured it probably doesn’t matter. Their dark minds are already hard at work imagining how to use blockchain as a system of repression and control.

I will be somewhat intentionally vague here, so as not to put all of these ideas out into the collective unconscious but think digital tracking of all aspects of your life from where you go and what do, to statistical predictions about your behavior, as well as behavioral algorithms designed to incentivize you to conform to an ideology, and lastly think unbreakable digital rights management and outright genocide.

Genocide?

Yeah.

**Don’t forget that** [**IBM helped the Nazis manage the holocaust with punch cards for tracking victims**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust)**.**

What could they have done with blockchain? Answer: Many more horrible atrocities that we can only begin to imagine now.

Maybe you think that an open system will always prevent abuses?

Wrong.

If the Internet has taught us anything it’s that open systems tend towards centralization and given enough time central powers can [and will subvert and corrupt any system](http://www.businessinsider.com/wannacry-nsa-cyber-weapon-leakers-shadow-brokers-promise-monthly-data-dumps-2017-5) to their own ends.

If you’re working in crypto and you’re not thinking about all the ways to misuse crypto then it’s very likely that instead of designing a system to save the world you just created a prison for it.

### 13) Bitcoin Has a 50/50 Shot At Surviving

Most true believers will not like this one but honestly, 50/50 might be really, really high here.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*s70767X_wJBDhrgFEqf8ug.jpeg)

I know, I know. You’ve heard it all before! The Money Badger can’t be stopped! New ATH!!!! Buy and HODLz forever!

Look you stuck with me this long so stick with me a little longer so I can explain.

First off, I’m rooting for Bitcoin to live until my dying days but let’s look at this objectively for a few minutes to see why it might go down hard. It’s probably not what you think.

Bitcoin has first mover advantage. It’s the absolute first of its kind and still dominates the global market share but it also suffers from a number of major flaws that could kill it.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3Hrfnp399fFqKYsZiLdKNA.jpeg)

Basically, it’s the Model T of the blockchain revolution.

How many Model T’s do you see on the street today?

Can you retrofit a Model T to make it burn rubber like a Lamborghini? Can you add sophisticated electronics to make it a self-driving Tesla? Nope.

To start with, Bitcoin has no built-in governance. This is a crucial flaw. Only a few ways to change it exist. The first is to [submit a proposal](https://coin.dance/blocks/proposals) where almost everyone agrees and as we have seen with SegWit, that’s incredibly hard. It took four years for the change to get adopted.

The second is to start a new project and hard fork it. This might be the only way this actually works in the end. A team might fork it and build in governance, but it’s a long shot.

A coin with well designed, widespread, build-in governance will have a massive advantage over Bitcoin and could easily replace it, as it makes upgrades seamless and smooth.

Upgrades and responses to attacks by well funded hostile forces will need to move fast and percolate throughout the network in hours or days, not years.

What about scaling? We already talked about that problem. Changing the blocksize won’t cut it. It will require something more radical.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*8DuarABxVGDxsyJGN0NicA.jpeg)

What if China turns the Great Firewall on it? Would it even be possible to retrofit private relays and other anti-interference code into the system at this late stage?

What if governments simply decide that they will spend a billion dollars on a datacenter and secretly designed ASICs to run the system? Could any miners compete?

What if hostiles just decided to round up all the core developers? How easy would it be to replace them considering the tremendous shortage of talent in the crypto world now?

These are only some of the nearly insurmountable problems of my favorite crypto. I point them out not to kill it but to make people think. If you can really see a problem you can find a way to fix it. But if we’re only going to deal with fake problems like the blocksize limit we will get nowhere.

Bitcoin is a beautiful, brilliant idea and it’s already changed the world. It won’t fail because it’s a fraud or a scam, but because of its own hard coded rules, in-fighting and lack of governance.

Of course, it doesn’t have to fail. We can start thinking about how to save it right here, right now.

As I noted earlier, some kind of virtualization or containerization that allows Bitcoin to adapt and evolve by migrating to an abstracted set of protocols and defenses would help ensure that it not only survives but thrives.

I’m rooting for it. I’m betting if you’re reading this, you are too.

The best way to make sure it survives is to understand all the real reasons it could fail and start designing real solutions to those problems today, so that when they do arrive, we’re ready.

### The Final Frontier

I have a lot more predictions but I’ll save them for [**my fiction**](https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Jeffries/e/B00D1HG62U). Maybe I’ll do a followup if this article goes viral.

I also left a few evil ideas off the table because I don’t want to see them come to pass. If someone else comes up with them, there’s nothing I can do about it but the worst scenarios in the Monte Carlo pathways of tomorrow will not come from my keyboard.

**Cryptocurrencies represent a fundamental upgrade to the economic systems of the world.** Once they’re fully booted up and integrated into the global and interplanetary networks of the future, the world will look very, very different in ways we can only begin to understand.

Hundreds of years from now, today’s economies will look like the feudal economies of the past.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SUddgH7g770fXRjiMemq9g.png)

Cyrptocurrencies, decentralized apps and DAOs even hold the possibility of bootstrapping us into **Star Trek like post-scarcity economies** but it will take time.

I’m not betting on Singularity level acceleration taking us there tomorrow, even if I sprinkle the Singularity into all my sci-fi work because it’s the stuff of great fiction. But it’s probably not reality.

If I’m wrong, then my uploaded and snapshotted virtual mind, running on a global fog of computronium in a [Matroishka brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef-mxjYkllw) will just have to deal with it.

But I doubt it.

So where does that leave us?

Crypto will be both good and evil like everything in life.

If you’re working on crypto then you’re building the world of tomorrow but don’t expect it to arrive next week.

Inertia has a way of slowing down even the fastest rockets.

Just enjoy the ride while we boldly go where no one has gone before.

As always, thanks for reading.
