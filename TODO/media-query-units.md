Have you wondered if you should use `px`, `em` or `rem` for media queries? I had the same question too, and I never figured it out, not till now.

When I first created the [mappy-breakpoint](https://github.com/zellwk/mappy-breakpoints) library over a year ago, I used `rem` units. Then [after a conversation](https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/issues/132) with Sam Richard, I quickly switched to `em` instead because I found out there isnâ€™t a difference between the two.

In addition to `em` and `rem`, a popular unit of choice for media queries is the good old pixel. I wondered if itâ€™s possible to use pixel queries nowadays since px-zooming problem that used to exist was now resolved by all browsers.

This week, I finally decided to get to the bottom of this matter.

Before we begin this article, Iâ€™m assuming that you already know what `em` and `rem` units are. Check [this article](http://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/) out if you donâ€™t.

## The Base Experiment

I thought of creating three separate `<div>` elements, one for `px`, one for `em` and one for `rem`. I gave each `<div>` a background color so it becomes easy to tell them apart.

    .pixel { background: red; }
    .em { background: green; }
    .rem { background: blue; }

Next, I created a `min-width` query on all three selectors since weâ€™re comparing the media query units.

When the query kicks in, I decided to decrease the opacity of the element so I can see the difference immediately. Hereâ€™s the CSS for the pixel-based media query:

    .pixel {
      background: red;  
      @media (min-width: 400px) {
        opacity: 0.5
      }
    }

The next step is to figure out how to create the `em` and `rem` units.

**In this first experiment, I wanted to test if there were differences between the three units if all conditions were ideal**. In other words, none of the following scenarios has happened:

1.  `font-size` changed in `<html>`
2.  user zoomed in.
3.  user changed their browserâ€™s font setting.

Since the conditions are ideal at this point, I can safely assume that `16px == 1em == 1rem`. `400px`, then, is equivalent to `25em` or `25rem`.

    .pixel {
      background: red;  
      @media (min-width: 400px) {
        opacity: 0.5
      }
    }

    .em {
      background: green;  
      // 400 Ã· 16 = 25
      @media (min-width: 25em) {
        opacity: 0.5
      }
    }

    .rem {
      background: blue;  
      // 400 Ã· 16 = 25
      @media (min-width: 25rem) {
        opacity: 0.5
      }
    }

**If all three media queries behave in the same manner, we should see all of them trigger at 400px exactly.**

And they did (on every browser I tested).

Since all three media queries kicked in at the same breakpoint, we know that **thereâ€™s no difference between `px`, `em` or `rem` queries at this stage**.

After establishing the base experiment, the next step is to test for less ideal conditions where any of the scenarios above occurred. Once again, the scenarios are:

1.  `font-size` changed in `<html>`
2.  user zoomed in.
3.  user changed their browserâ€™s font setting.

Letâ€™s go through them one by one.

## 1\. Font-size Changed in HTML

The first scenario is incredibly common. In fact, almost all web pages use this method set the default `font-size` property in their CSS:

  html { 
    // setting default font size 
    font-size: 200% 
  }
Here, I chose to use a `font-size` of 200% in my test, which means that Iâ€™m setting both `1em` and `1rem` as `32px`. **If `em` and `rem` are affected by this change in `font-size`, they should only trigger at `800px`**

Hereâ€™s the result: Chrome, Firefox and IE 11 triggered all three media queries at 400px:

This is the correct behavior. **`em` and `rem` units should not be affected by changes in `font-size` in the HTML** since theyâ€™re based on the browserâ€™s internal `font-size` property.

Unfortunately, we didnâ€™t get the perfect behavior on Safari. It triggered the `rem` media query at 800px :(

Since this behavior only occurs on Safari, I was curious to see if mobile Safari was affected as well. Turns out, it did.

**So, the first scenario already showed us that we shouldnâ€™t use `rem` media queries.** However, letâ€™s continue to put rem in the rest of our experiments to see if anything else comes up.

## 2\. User Zooms In

The second scenario is common as well. If the text on your page isnâ€™t large enough, **users may choose to use the zoom function built into their browser to enlarge the text.**

A quick note here: The original idea behind `em` based sizes was due to older browsers not being able to update pixel values when a user zooms. In this regard, testing the difference between media query units when a user zooms will help to answer the question on whether we can use `px` based media queries now.

The results from this experiment is that Chrome, Firefox and IE showed the same behavior. `px` unit queries fired at the same time as `em` and `rem` queries.

And you guessed itâ€¦ Safari didnâ€™t :(

**Unfortunately, this means that pixel based media queries are out of the question**. Safari doesnâ€™t support them properly (unless you decide to forsake Safari?).

Once again, move on to our final experiment to see if anything unexpected comes up still.

## 3\. User Changed Their Browserâ€™s Font Setting.

**Many developers like to believe that [users donâ€™t change their browserâ€™s `font-size`](http://nicolas-hoizey.com/2016/03/people-don-t-change-the-default-16px-font-size-in-their-browser.html) since itâ€™s hidden deeeep inside the settings.**

Well, itâ€™ll be awesome if all users exhibit this behavior because we donâ€™t have to do this experiment! :)

Unfortunately, thereâ€™s no data to proof that users donâ€™t change their browserâ€™s `font-size`s, so **itâ€™s still our duty as developers to bake the flexibility into our websites.**

In this experiment, I enlarged the default `font-size` of the four browsers I tested with in the following way (incase you wanted to follow along):

*   **Chrome:** Go to `settings`, `show advanced settings`, `web-content`.
*   **Firefox:** Go to `preferences`, `content`, `fonts and colors`.
*   **Internet Explorer:** Click on `page`, then `text-size`

The only browser I couldnâ€™t figure out where to set the font-size was **Safari**. So I used a proxy instead. I change the settings such that the smallest font-size is larger than 16px. To do so, go to `preferences`, `advanced`, `acessibility`.

**This was the only test that all browsers behaved in the same way:**

![Results from all browsers for scenario 3](http://zellwk.com/images/2016/media-query-units/chrome-very-large-font-size.gif)

<figcaption>Results from all browsers for scenario 3</figcaption>

As you can see, the pixel queries triggered earlier than `em` or `rem` queries.

There arenâ€™t any bugs here. This is the correct implementation since px are absolute units. The breakpoint should remain at 400px no matter what the user setâ€™s their default `font-size` to.

`em` and `rem`, on the other hand, is based on the `font-size` of the browser. Hence, their media queries should get updated when the user changes their default `font-size` setting.

So.. **Iâ€™m sorry to break your bubble, pixel fans, but itâ€™s a no-go for pixel based queries**. ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

## Concluding The Experiments

As you can see from our tests above, **the only unit that performed consistently across all four browsers is `em`**. There arenâ€™t any differences between `em` and `rem` with the exception of bugs found on Safari.

`px` media queries performed well in two of the three experiments (with the exception of Safari, again). Unfortunately, `px` media queries remained at `400px` in the third experiment, which makes it a no-go if you intend to support users who change their browserâ€™s `font-size` value.

Hence, my conclusion after these experiments is: **Use `em` media queries**.

If youâ€™re using a library that doesnâ€™t do `em` media queries, point the developer to this article so they know the implications of their code. Otherwise, feel free to switch to a `em` based library like [Mappy-breakpoints](https://github.com/zellwk/mappy-breakpoints), [Breakpoint-sass](http://breakpoint-sass.com) or [sass-mq](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq).
