Just to clarify, this won't be a detailed technical guide about how you can build your own authentication layer using [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) + [Lua](http://www.lua.org), rather it is a document explaining the process behind the solution.

This is a real example of how [moltin](https://moltin.com)'s API has come to rely on [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) + [Lua](http://www.lua.org) to handle our oauth2 authentication for all users.

The logic used to authenticate a user was originally embedded into [moltin](https://moltin.com)'s API, built using the PHP Framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). This means a lot of code had to be booted before we could authenticate, reject or validate a user request resulting in a high latency.

I'm not going to give details about how much time a PHP Framework could take to give a basic response, but if we compare it to other languages/frameworks, you can probably understand.

This is roughly how it looked at that time:

    ...
    public function filter($route, $request) {
        try {
            // Initiate the Request handler
            $this->request = new OAuthRequest;
            // Initiate the auth server with the models
            $this->server  = new OAuthResource(new OAuthSession);
            // Is it a valid token?   
            if ($this->accessTokenValid() == false) {
                throw new InvalidAccessTokenException('Unable to validate access token');
            }
    ...

So we decided to move all logic one layer up to [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) + [Lua](http://www.lua.org) which achieved the following:

*   Decoupled responsibilities from our Monolitic API.
*   Improved authentication times and generated access/refresh tokens.
*   Improved times for rejecting invalid access tokens or authentication credentials.
*   Improved times when validating an access token and redirecting the request to the API.

We wanted, and needed, to have more control on each request before hitting the actual API and so we decided to use something fast enough to allow us to pre-process each request and flexible enough to be integrated into our actual system. Doing this led us to use `OpenResty`, a modified version of [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), that allowed us to use [Lua](http://www.lua.org), the language used to pre-process those requests. Why? Because it's robust and fast enough to use for these purposes and it's a highly recognised scripting language used daily by many large companies.

We followed the concept behind [Kong](https://github.com/Mashape/kong), who use [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) + [Lua](http://www.lua.org), to offer several micro-services that could be plugged into your API project. However we found that Kong is in a very early stage and is actually trying to offer more than what we needed therefore we decided to implement our own Auth layer to allow us to have more control over it.

### Infrastructure

Below is how [moltin](https://moltin.com)'s infrastructure currently looks:

![](https://moltin.com/files/large/67b084c60b6d0ff)

*   OpenResty (Nginx)
*   Lua scripts
*   Caching Layer (Redis)

#### OpenResty

This is the bit that rules them all.

![](https://moltin.com/files/large/8b359a7b2bad55a)

We have routing in place to process each of the different user's requests as you can see below:

**nginx.conf**

    location ~/oauth/access_token {
        ...
    }
    location /v1 {
        ...
    }

So for each of those endpoints we have to:

*   check the authentication access token
*   get the authentication access token

    ...
    location ~/oauth/access_token {
        content_by_lua_file "/opt/openresty/nginx/conf/oauth/get_oauth_access.lua";
        ...
    }

    location /v1 {
        access_by_lua_file "/opt/openresty/nginx/conf/oauth/check_oauth_access.lua";
       ...
    }
    ...

We make use of the OpenResty directives [content_by_lua_file](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#content_by_lua_file) and [access_by_lua_file](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#access_by_lua_file).

#### Lua Scripts

This is where all the magic happens. We have two scripts to do this:

**get_oauth_access.lua**

    ...
    ngx.req.read_body()
    args, err = ngx.req.get_post_args()

    -- If we don't get any post data fail with a bad request
    if not args then
        return api:respondBadRequest()
    end

    -- Check the grant type and pass off to the correct function
    -- Or fail with a bad request
    for key, val in pairs(args) do
        if key == "grant_type" then
            if val == "client_credentials" then
                ClientCredentials.new(args)
            elseif val == "password" then
                Password.new(args)
            elseif val == "implicit" then
                Implicit.new(args)
            elseif val == "refresh_token" then
                RefreshToken.new(args)
            else
                return api:respondForbidden()
            end
        end
    end

    return api:respondOk()
    ...

**check_oauth_access.lua**

    ...
    local authorization, err = ngx.req.get_headers()["authorization"]

    -- If we have no access token forbid the beasts
    if not authorization then
        return api:respondUnauthorized()
    end

    -- Check for the access token
    local result = oauth2.getStoredAccessToken(token)

    if result == false then
        return api:respondUnauthorized()
    end
    ...

#### Caching Layer

This is where the created access tokens are stored. We can remove, expire or refresh them as we please. We use Redis as a storage layer and we use [openresty/lua-resty-redis](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis) to connect Lua to [Redis](http://redis.io/).
