# A Flexible Routing Approach in an iOS App

‚ÄúTrollstigen‚Äù

At [_Rosberry_](http://about.rosberry.com) we‚Äôve given up on using storyboards, except the Launch Screen, of course, and configure all layout and transition logic in code. In order to understand our reasons‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääread the [_Life without Interface Builder_](https://blog.zeplin.io/life-without-interface-builder-adbb009d2068)written by ‚Äôs team, I hope you will find this post useful.

In this article, I‚Äôm going to introduce a new approach to routing between view controllers. We‚Äôll start with a problem and step by step will come to a final decision. Enjoy reading!

* * *

#### Dive into the problem

Let‚Äôs figure out the problem using a specific example. For instance, we‚Äôre going to build a social app with profiles, list of friends, chats and so on. Definitely, we can notice that it‚Äôs necessary to show a user‚Äôs profile from many controllers and it would be great to implement this logic once and reuse it. [**DRY**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**,** we remember you! We can‚Äôt achieve it by using storyboards, you may imagine how it‚Äôd look within a storyboard‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääweeeeb. üò¨

At present, we‚Äôre using the _MVVM+Router_ architecture. _ViewModel_ says to _Router_ that a transition to another module is needed and the router does it. In our case _Router_ just takes all the transition logic in order not to come to the massive view controller (or view model). If it looks unclear to you at the beginning, please don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôm going to explain this solution in a plain way, so it will be easily adapted to the simple _MVC_ as well.

* * *

#### Solution

**1.** At first it would possibly look like an obvious solution is adding an extension to _ViewController:_

```
extension UIViewController {
    func openProfile(for user: User) {
        let profileViewController = ProfileViewController(user: user)
        present(profileViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

and it works as needed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwrite once, then reuse. But it‚Äôll become messy when many transitions come. Xcode autocompletion doesn‚Äôt work well I know, but sometimes it can show you a lot of unnecessary methods. Even if you don‚Äôt want to show a profile from this screen, it‚Äôll be there. So, go further and try to improve this one.

**2.** Rather than writing an extension to _ViewController_ and have tons of methods in one place, let‚Äôs implement every route in a separated _Protocol_ and use the awesome feature of swift‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprotocol extension.

```
protocol ProfileRoute {
    func openProfile(for user: User)
}

extension ProfileRoute where Self: UIViewController {
    func openProfile(for user: User) {
        let profileViewController = ProfileViewController(user: user)
        present(profileViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}

final class FriendsViewController: UIViewController, ProfileRoute {}
```

Now, this approach is more flexible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe can extend a view controller with needed routes only (avoid tons of methods), just add a route to the controller‚Äôs inheritance. üéâ

**3.** But of course there‚Äôre some improvements:

*   What if we want to have a modal transition to the profile controller from all places except one? (it‚Äôs a rare case, but anyway).
*   Or more importantly‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIf I change the presentation type, I should change the type of a dismiss transition as well (present / dismiss).

We don‚Äôt have a chance to configure it for now, so it‚Äôs time to implement a _Transition_ abstraction with few implementations‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_ModalTransition_ and _PushTransition:_

```
protocol Transition: class {
    weak var viewController: UIViewController? { get set }

    func open(_ viewController: UIViewController)
    func close(_ viewController: UIViewController)
}
```

I reduced a bit the implementation logic of the _ModalTransition_ just for simplicity. A full version is available in [Github](https://github.com/Otbivnoe/Routing/blob/master/Routing/Routing/Transitions/ModalTransition.swift).

```
class ModalTransition: NSObject {
    var animator: Animator?
    weak var viewController: UIViewController?

    init(animator: Animator? = nil) {
        self.animator = animator
    }
}

extension ModalTransition: Transition {}
extension ModalTransition: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {}
```

and the similar reduced logic of the [_PushTransition_](https://github.com/Otbivnoe/Routing/blob/master/Routing/Routing/Transitions/PushTransition.swift)_:_

```
class PushTransition: NSObject {
    var animator: Animator?
    weak var viewController: UIViewController?

    init(animator: Animator? = nil) {
        self.animator = animator
    }
}

extension PushTransition: Transition {}
extension PushTransition: UINavigationControllerDelegate {}
```

You definitely have noticed the _Animator_ object, so it‚Äôs a simple protocol for custom transitions:

```
protocol Animator: UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning {
    var isPresenting: Bool { get set }
}
```

As I said earlier about a massive view controller, let‚Äôs add an object that comprises the whole routing logic and is contained as a property in a view controller. We meet _Router‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_a base class for all future routers. üéâ

```
protocol Closable: class {
    func close()
}

protocol RouterProtocol: class {
    associatedtype V: UIViewController
    weak var viewController: V? { get }
    
    func open(_ viewController: UIViewController, transition: Transition)
}

class Router<U>: RouterProtocol, Closable where U: UIViewController {
    typealias V = U
    
    weak var viewController: V?
    var openTransition: Transition?

    func open(_ viewController: UIViewController, transition: Transition) {
        transition.viewController = self.viewController
        transition.open(viewController)
    }

    func close() {
        guard let openTransition = openTransition else {
            assertionFailure("You should specify an open transition in order to close a module.")
            return
        }
        guard let viewController = viewController else {
            assertionFailure("Nothing to close.")
            return
        }
        openTransition.close(viewController)
    }
}
```

Please, spend a bit time to understand this code. This class contains two methods for opening and closing, a reference to a view controller and an `openTransition` in order to know how to close this module.

Now using this new class let‚Äôs update our _ProfileRoute_:

```
protocol ProfileRoute {
    var profileTransition: Transition { get }
    func openProfile(for user: User)
}

extension ProfileRoute where Self: RouterProtocol {

    var profileTransition: Transition {
        return ModalTransition()
    }

    func openProfile(for user: User) {
        let router = ProfileRouter()
        let profileViewController = ProfileViewController(router: router)
        router.viewController = profileViewController

        let transition = profileTransition // it's a calculated property so I saved it to the variable in order to have one instance
        router.openTransition = transition
        open(profileViewController, transition: transition)
    }
}
```

You can see that the default transition is modal and in`openProfile` method we generate new module and open it (of course it‚Äôs better to use a builder or factory to generate a module). Also, pay attention to a `transition` variable, `profileTransition` is saved to this variable in order to have one instance.

The next step is updating the _Friends_ module:

```
final class FriendsRouter: Router<FriendsViewController>, FriendsRouter.Routes  {
    typealias Routes = ProfileRoute & /* other routes */ 
}

final class FriendsViewController: UIViewController {

    private let router: FriendsRouter.Routes

    init(router: FriendsRouter.Routes) {
        self.router = router
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }
  
    func userButtonPressed() {
        router.openProfile(for: /* some user */)
    }
}
```

We‚Äôve created the _FriendsRouter_ and added the needed routes via _typealias_. Here‚Äôs where magic happens! We use protocol composition (**&**) to add more routes and protocol‚Äôs extension to use a default implementation for routing. üòé

The last step in this story is how easily and nicely a close transition can be achieved. If you recall _ProfileRouter_, there we‚Äôve configured `openTransition` and now we can take advantage of it.

I created a _Profile_ module with only one route‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_close_ and when a user clicks a close button, we use the same transition type to close this module.

```
final class ProfileRouter: Router<ProfileViewController> {
    typealias Routes = Closable
}

final class ProfileViewController: UIViewController {

    private let router: ProfileRouter.Routes

    init(router: ProfileRouter.Routes) {
        self.router = router
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    }

    func closeButtonPressed() {
        router.close()
    }
}
```

If necessary to change a transition type, just change it in the protocol extension of _ProfileRoute_ and this code will continue working without any changes! Awesome, isn‚Äôt it?

* * *

#### Conclusion

At the end, I want to say that this Routing approach can be simply adapted to _MVC_, _VIPER, MVVM_ architectures and even if you use _Coordinators_, they can work together. I‚Äôm trying my best to improve this solution and will listen to your bits of advice with pleasure!

For those who are interested in this solution, I prepared the [example](https://github.com/Otbivnoe/Routing) with few modules and different transition between them to understand it more deeply. Download and play!
