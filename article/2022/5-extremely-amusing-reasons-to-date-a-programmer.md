# 5 Extremely Amusing Reasons to Date a Programmer

> Date a developer...
>
> We break code, not hearts.

Developers are creative and learn new things every day. They are fast learners.

But most people consider them geeks and nerds. They imagine that it won’t be fun to hang out with the programmers, that they won’t care, and that they will talk about boring things.

However, the developers are quite opposed to that. It’s fun hanging out with us and of course, we love memes.

## 1. They use logical thinking in their life

Programmers in their daily work use logic more than any other professional. We spend a lot of time writing logic code. You can notice this in a simple if-else statement.

As programmers, we understand the if-else statement well. If a certain condition is true, the block of code available under it will be executed. Otherwise, the code inside the else statement will be executed.

Programmers write meaningful names for functions names so that when someone reads them later. It will not be difficult for them to understand it. We keep the codebase organized.

When you carry this habit of thinking logically into developers dating life. You will understand that they will maintain logical thinking with their partners. They will remove the drama from there, as well as the lives of their partners.

They will keep everything simple and will not try to complicate things in their partner’s life.

## 2. They are down-to-earth human beings.

I have met several developers in my life. I have asked different types of programmers on the internet for help. You know what’s unique about them, all of them at least tried to help.

If they didn’t have answers to my questions. They told me directly that they do not have the answer to those questions. The coding community is the most realistic community on the Internet.

If you try to get help from a lead software engineer in a company and if they can help you. They will surely help you. Some of them even guide you to the right resources or the right people who can help you.

Even if you take an example of a stack overflow website. It is the best technical support in the world that you will ever get. I have never seen so many unknown people helping unknown people without asking for money or anything tangible.

It means that when you date a programmer, they will do a lot of nice things for you without expecting anything in return. They will help you on your worst days in any way possible.

They will understand your situation whenever you need something. They will stay on your side. They will not make decisions that may upset you in any way. They will take care of you.

## 3. You could go on a world tour with a programmer

Skilled programmers are always in demand. Almost all companies want to hire good programmers who can build products. Programmers create applications that could make people’s lives easier.

Programmers only need two things to work. All they need is a laptop (preferably a MacBook) and an internet connection. With just these two things they can make great products for any business.

Since the programmers do not need to be present in the office. They can work remotely for the long term. Companies like Google have given programmers to work remotely for their entire careers.

The programmer does not need to be present in a specific place to do their work. Along with that, the programmers are very well paid. If a programmer has great skills, he can easily crack good company interviews.

By working totally remotely and earning a good amount of money. They can afford to go on a world tour with their partners. Even while working remotely, they will be able to work for their dream companies.

So if you are looking to date someone who can afford to go on a world tour with you. In addition to offering a great lifestyle. Pick a programmer to date. They can make your dream come true.

## 4. Latest gadgets all over your home

In a programmer’s life, be it for our work purpose or for fun. You will find the latest gadgets in a programmer's house. Programmers make a lot of money and can afford the latest gadgets.

They love exploring new technologies and are willing to pay the price for the latest products.

This curiosity to explore and discover new technological products makes them connoisseurs of different types of products. You can take programmers’ recommendations very seriously.

As it is very likely that either they have used the product personally or that some of their developer friends have used them. Since the coding community is always trying to be helpful, you will get amazing suggestions.

If you will have a partner who has the latest knowledge about technology products. Your life will become easy. All products are becoming dependent on technology day by day. You will have someone to discuss and make a purchase decision.

Along with that, your home will be full of tech products. All programmers love to own all the latest and geeky products. Your home will be a fun place to be.

## 5. They can learn a new language fast

A programmer may only speak one language. They still dominate many other programming languages. Consider a web developer, for example, he or she will know HTML (I don’t know whether to call it a language), CSS, and Javascript.

Even to do basic work, a web developer must learn all of the above languages. To do advanced work, a web developer has to learn frameworks like React and other things.

Programmers are very quick to learn new languages. Not only will they master the new language learned, but they will still remember the languages they learned in the past.

If you take it to romance, even if the programmer can’t speak the language of love, he can learn it pretty quickly. They will do their best to learn a new language and will try to communicate clearly with their partner.

They can also help you learn a programming language. Yes, they are quite addictive that way. They will be able to convince their partner to learn a programming language.

## Summary

1. They use logical thinking.
2. They are down-to-earth human beings.
3. You could go on a world tour with a programmer.
4. All the latest gadgets will be available at home.
5. They can quickly learn to speak romantically.
