# 100 Tips on Software Developer Productivity

_I've developed software professionally for the past 10 years. Here's a list of 100 things I've learned about **software developer productivity**._

-   At the beginning of your career, learning to "code fast" significantly impacts your productivity. Once you're "good enough," the impact substantially diminishes. Pay attention to when this happens.
    
-   Don't be too proud to try and" hack your mind." Many productivity tips that sound patronizing actually work.
    
-   Write your tasks down and use a to-do list.
    
-   Having a tangible goal will make you move faster.
    
-   Procastination is normal. Start by writing a single line.
    
-   What works for someone else might not work for you.
    
-   Try Pomodoro. It might work for you.
    
-   Learn what makes you productive.
    
-   Set boundaries that enable you to work in a way that makes you productive.
    
-   Strong intrinsic motivation and curiosity trumps all productivity hacks.
    
-   Learn how to tap into your intrinsic motivation. 
    
-   Pair program and watch other people code. You might pick up a skill or two that help you work faster.
    
-   Your intuition affects your productivity more than you know. Pay attention to cultivating a good intuition.
    
-   Learning out of a bad habit takes work. Invest in learning good habits.
    
-   Saying "yes" to everything will destroy your productivity. You need a personal WIP limit.
    
-   Being obsessed about your work will make you temporarily more productive but burn you out if stretched for too long.
    
-   Physical exercise, eating healthy, and sleeping well do not take away, but _contribute_ to your productivity.
    
-   Take regular breaks (e.g., 10 minutes every 50 minutes). 
    
-   Trying to work in too long stretches will teach your brain to start wandering off to memes and hot takes on Twitter.
    
-   Make sure you have enough focus time for deep work and "flow." 
    
-   Disable all the notifications you can.
    
-   Being in "flow" makes you feel productive but does not always mean you're making progress.
    
-   You can spend hours polishing an abstraction but deliver zero customer and business value.
    
-   Being productive does not mean you're making an impact. Work hard on things that matter.
    
-   The more experience I get, the more I'm interested in improving how my team or organization works together vs. optimizing my individual productivity.
    
-   When solving technical problems that require collaboration, the bottleneck for individual developer productivity is not your ability to write code but the team's ability to create viable solutions.
    
-   Most problems in building great software products require collaboration. Your ability to collaborate will become a bottleneck.
    
-   You will be more productive in some teams/companies than others.
    
-   Eventually, the bottleneck for your productivity will be the team and organization surrounding you.
    
-   Developer productivity and compensation don't often go hand in hand.
    
-   Some companies will compensate you more for the same work than others.
    
-   The best "10x engineers" are the ones who 10x the team and people working around them.
    
-   Delegate and help other people. Learn to celebrate their success.
    
-   Learn to use automation. Removing errors and reducing cognitive load has a more significant impact on your productivity than "working faster."
    
-   Developer experience and ergonomics matter.
    
-   Automatically format your code with a deterministic code formatter like Prettier or Black.
    
-   Use a linter. Learn how to write custom rules to match the way your team works.
    
-   Write automated tests. Life is too short for constantly fixing trivial bugs.
    
-   Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is likely easier than you think. Learning how to do it will save you time in every future software project.
    
-   Keep feedback loops fast.
    
-   Automatically deploy to production.
    
-   Keep your build times low.
    
-   Make sure developers can run the test suite on their computers.
    
-   Enable automatically running related tests on file changes.
    
-   Use feature flags to allow shipping work faster to production.
    
-   You might not need a staging environment.
    
-   You might benefit from a staging environment.
    
-   It depends.
    
-   Developers using Vim look like they're much more productive than the rest.
    
-   Don't always pick the tasks that make you feel most productive. It will stagnate your learning and make you feel that you're not moving forward.
    
-   Prioritize reviewing code. It will help your team stay productive.
    
-   Every time a developer prioritizes reviewing code, a new star is born in the Torvalds & Carmack galaxy.
    
-   Being "agile" has very little practical meaning.
    
-   Calculating velocity and story points rarely help teams improve their productivity.
    
-   Small, practical change based on data trump "agile transformation."
    
-   The goal of planning is to split the elephant into bite-sized pieces.
    
-   Developers often prefer working alone on large tasks for long periods.
    
-   Developers working alone on large tasks for long periods rarely result in the smallest possible increment being shipped fast.
    
-   Working together on a task is often less productive in the short run.
    
-   Working together on a task improves learning and is often more productive in the long run.
    
-   With large codebases, developer productivity largely depends on their knowledge of the system.
    
-   Splitting large codebases into modules helps new developers become productive faster.
    
-   Modular architecture only works if the API contracts are clear and modules are truly decoupled from each other.
    
-   Sometimes, a developer is more productive than others only because they have more knowledge and power.
    
-   A single developer owning a disproportionate amount of knowledge and power in a team will lead to some developers underperforming.
    
-   A "10x engineer" born out of owning a disproportionate amount of knowledge and power is an anti-pattern and will lead to capable developers leaving your company. Avoid it at all costs.
    
-   Measuring developer productivity only through activity (e.g. # of commits or PR reviews) does not work.
    
-   Trying to condense developer productivity into a single metric will fail and make developers lose their trust in the company's management.
    
-   Measuring individual developer productivity is hard. If you try to do that, you will likely lose more than gain.
    
-   When trying to measure developer productivity, data quality is crucial. Bad decisions made based on poor data are costly.
    
-   There is much more reliable research on software developer productivity than most developers realize.
    
-   Focusing on team and organizational level developer productivity will yield the best results.
    
-   Reading the book "Accelerate" and understanding the SPACE framework will give you a good start to understanding development team productivity.
    
-   When measuring developer productivity, you should have multiple metrics that complement and challenge each other.
    
-   The subjective experience of developers is valuable data.
    
-   Only relying on the subjective experience of developers is not enough. Especially when trying to improve development productivity across the organization.
    
-   Improving software team productivity is largely about trying to improve the flow of work while keeping quality high and working at a sustainable pace.
    
-   Measuring your team's cycle time and deployment frequency will help you improve your flow of work.
    
-   Knowing how much time your team spends fixing bugs vs. feature work will help you prioritize writing tests, fix technical debt, and keep your quality high.
    
-   Developing software is a marathon, not a sprint. Optimize accordingly.
    
-   Teams should be in charge of improving their own productivity and have access to the necessary metrics and tools.
    
-   Individual developers benefit from understanding what affects their teams' overall productivity.
    
-   Most teams try to do too many things at the same time. You need a WIP limit.
    
-   WIP limits improve collaboration and help you ship the most important stuff.
    
-   WIP limits reduce procrastination on hard tasks.
    
-   WIP limits combined with good prioritization help individual developers work on things they're not familiar with and encourage learning.
    
-   Encouraging learning makes software developers more productive in the long run.
    
-   Consistently good work is better than heroics.
    
-   Organizations that put heroism above consistently good work perform worse in the long run.
    
-   Developers love to measure everything else but their own productivity.
    
-   Early attempts at measuring software developer productivity ruined the whole thing for most developers.
    
-   It is hard to recover from industry trauma.
    
-   Don't focus on measuring individual developers if you're trying to improve your company's software development speed.
    
-   Learning about Lean and Queuing theory is valuable when improving software team productivity.
    
-   Consultants have done a great job ruining Lean for the rest of us.
    
-   Measuring software team productivity can make engineering teams happier.
    
-   Measuring software team productivity only makes teams happier and more productive if they're on board.
    
-   If developers are not on board, your metrics will be gamed.
    
-   Not giving your developers proper autonomy and control over their work will make them unhappy. Do not micromanage.
    
-   Happy engineers are more productive.
