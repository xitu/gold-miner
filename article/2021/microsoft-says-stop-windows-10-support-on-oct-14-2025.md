## HIGHLIGHTS

* Microsoft, in 2015 during the launch of Windows 10, said that it is the “last Windows version”.
* However, the company is known to be working on a successor to Windows 10, which might be launched later this month.

With a new version of Windows, potentially called Windows 11, scheduled to launch by the end of this month, Microsoft has announced that support for Windows 10 will end on October 14, 2025.

Microsoft has listed the EOL (End of Life) for the Windows 10 operating system for both Home and Pro versions via its website. It means that the latest updated version of Windows 10 will cease to be supported for updates and security as the company pushes towards its newer OS (operating systems) offerings.

When a company stops updating an operating system, referred to as End of Life (EOL), it usually means that the operating system is essentially dead, and users will be encouraged to move to a successor.

At the moment, Microsoft has not yet officially stated what the next generation of the OS would be called, although they have been hinting at it being Windows 11. Microsoft is hosting a special event on June 24 where there is likely to be an official announcement regarding the successor of Windows 10.

The event will kick off at 8:30 pm IST on June 24, 2021. Microsoft confirmed this news via its official Twitter handle. At the Microsoft Build 2021 event, the company’s CEO Satya Nadella confirmed the next-generation Windows update would be the most significant one of the past decades.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, during last month’s Build 2021 conference, said, “Soon we will share one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade to unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators. I’ve been self-hosting it over the past several months, and I’m incredibly excited about the next generation of Windows.”

Windows 11 is expected to get a major UI overhaul. It is reported that Microsoft has also been working on a new app store for Windows in recent months, and rumours have suggested Microsoft will open its store up to all apps and rival payment platforms.

As far as the Windows 10 retirement is concerned, it is likely that the Windows version might last longer than 2025 as people often take quite a bit of time to upgrade from one Windows operating system to another. Microsoft will likely give extra time to people to migrate over to the new operating system.
