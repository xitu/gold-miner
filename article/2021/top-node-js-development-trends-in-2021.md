# Top Node.js Development Trends in 2021

Lots of predictions for trends in Node.js for the year 2021 are being assumed by developers across the globe. In the following paragraphs, we are going to explain the expected Node.js trends for this year.

## For what reason is Node.js so well-known?

Node.js has become so popular in recent years due to its high flexibility and extremely lightweight property. Node.js features a vast library of JavaScript modules for streamlining the development procedure. Because of its open-source attribute, Node.js has become extremely well-known for [**web and mobile app development**](https://www.rlogical.com/).

**According to recent statistics, it has been shown that:**

- Over 50% of the developers make use of Node.js in their projects at present.
- Over 28000 websites have been created on Node.js technology in the USA.
- Big names such as AliExpress and eBay rely considerably on Node.js.
- Websites receiving heavy traffic, including PayPal, Netflix, and Groupon, make use of Node.JS.

* Node.js had become extremely popular **since 2009** when it was first introduced on the market. **Node.js has 75.9k stars, 3k watchers, plus 19k forks In Github.** It has got **71.8k followers along with 8.3k votes in Stack share.** These numbers are sufficient to depict how popular Node.js happens to be. Well-known tech giants such as Netflix and Microsoft use Node.js. Node.js succeeded in winning the **top position in the 2020 developer survey of StackOverflow.** More than 50% of the participants in that particular survey reported using Node JS in their projects.

### 1. MEAN & MERN Stack

Both MEAN as well as MERN Stack is quite powerful. And it is AngularJS and React that make it so potent. While **MEAN Stack combines ExpressJS, MongoDB, AngularJS, and NodeJS**, MERN Stack employs React rather than Angular.

AngularJS can write easy and clean code using three different components: class, template, and metadata. It happens to be a Model-View-Controller Framework. The 2-way data binding will be appropriate if the developers of a [N**odeJS development company**](https://www.rlogical.com/hire-dedicated-developers/hire-node-js-developer/) are dealing with a simple project.

It implies that any modifications that have taken place within the model will impact the view instantly and vice versa. 1-way data binding happens to be quite handy for developers, particularly for complicated projects. It will be possible to make use of Angular with Typescript for building apps.

MERN, a comparatively new tech stack, has got React at its disposal. The user acceptance and popularity gained by React are quite useful for [**MERN stack development**](https://www.rlogical.com/hire-dedicated-developers/hire-mern-stack-developer/).

React outshines Angular due to its virtual DOM that is quite effective in performing modifications quickly. Moreover, it employs advanced JavaScript that operates components swiftly. Although React is powerful, being a library, it comes with certain limitations. It needs to take the help of third-party services on some occasions.

### 2. Real-Time Applications

The real-time applications are trending and will be staying on the top of the charts. These apps require a powerful and robust backend. Perfect examples are **Instant Messaging, Video Calling, and Online Gaming, along with lots of other similar applications.**

Node.js **uses Event API and Websocket for getting the 2-way interaction** that is essential in real-time applications. In short, it can be asserted that real-time apps have a bright future ahead of them.

### 3. Internet of Things

Nodejs happens to be a runtime environment rich in features and enables developers to apply data-oriented and on-time capabilities, plus microservices.

The world has accepted technological transformations. If you would like to cope with it, it will be imperative to adapt to this contemporary technology.

Real-time apps have to handle plenty of user requests, and therefore, node.js has become a helping hand. Apart from delivering quality apps, it likewise creates a sure-shot solution.

As a result, you can have faith in node.js for assisting you in [**creating IoT Apps**](https://www.rlogical.com/iot-development/) for your customers.

### 4. Serverless Solution

Every individual likes to save money plus enhance the productivity and efficiency of the developers. Node.js happens to be a fantastic solution when it comes to serverless architecture.

The cost of maintaining it is almost zero, and it doesn’t need companies to consider while deciding their performance. Apart from this, it can boast of having a global community.

Almost every big company like **AOL, Netflix, and Telenor takes advantage of serverless** architecture.

**These advantages are as follows:**

- Enhancement in quality of code
- Lessening in project cost
- Saves plenty of time
- Increase in efficiency

It is amongst the most incredible node.JS development trends that the world will witness in the upcoming days.

### 5. Cloud Solutions

The point outlined above happens to be the solution for **developing cloud apps**. It will be possible to simplify the cloud app construction by the serverless structure either from the beginning or scaling apps that have been already developed.

According to the study of the information week, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, plus machine learning models will be ruling the planet.

### 6. GraphQL

GraphQL is known to be a successful option for RESTful API. It enables programmers to precisely elucidate any information needed by it. It is effective in collecting huge information from diverse sources.

GraphQL, one more node.js trend, is found to be developing every year. It has slowly caught the attention of programmers around the world. We can presume that it will be growing significantly.

GraphQL will be able to streamline the workflow of different platforms like Windows, Android, or iOS. Therefore, it will be the favorite and prospering feature of the developers.

### 7. Microservice

Microservice, which happens to be a substitute for a serverless approach, is an architectural technique. The code’s maintenance is dependent on microservice, and it deals with the code quality responsibly.

Furthermore, the microservices enable no-dependency plus free functioning of the apps. You can use microservice for creating top-quality projects.

Microservice architecture is expanding at all times and can prove to be an effective investment.

## NodeJS — An Appealing Runtime Environment

NodeJS provides quite a few features that outperform other frameworks, and some of them are as follows:

- Event-Driven and Asynchronous
- Full-Stack application development framework
- Easy to learn as well as demanding in the market
- Built on top of the V8 engine of Chrome
- Single-Threaded
- Huge community support

It happens to be a promising application constructor that enables **[web & mobile app developers](https://www.rlogical.com/hire-dedicated-developers)** to use its libraries and various other tools plus technologies.

According to recent statistics, you will find around 194K+ sites that have been built by making use of Node.js, and this demonstrates its popularity.
