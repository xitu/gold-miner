# Node.js vs. Python: Which One to Choose for Your Project?

Node.js and Python are two of the most compared backend technologies on the web. Since both are very popular for web-app development, a thorough comparison is necessary before you choose one over the other. In this article, explore which of the two best suits your development needs and when.

## What is Node.js?

Since Node.js is event-driven, it’s scalable and brings phenomenal efficiencies to the project. Its asynchronous nature equips it to handle concurrent requests without blocking the I/O operations. Most development teams prefer Node.js to use JavaScript on both clients and server-side.

## What is Python?

On the flip side, Python is a full-fledged, high-level, and object-oriented programming language. Since it’s been around for close to 30 years, it has a ton of libraries, APIs, and ancillary tools available. Python is conducive to several programming paradigms, and it’s extensively used for business applications.

---

Its community, libraries, and supporting platforms are far reaching. Hence, it is an ideal programming language for most businesses that are required to develop applications for different and often uncorrelated use cases.

## The popularity of Node.js and Python

The popularity of a backend technology plays a critical role in whether it’ll be used for your project.

First off from the company’s perspective, the development team has to decide which language has a significant degree of talent available in the market. And then from the POV of programmers, a decision has to be reached whether they are willing to pick up languages that are predominantly used by many companies.

Looking at the popularity of websites, [SimilarWeb](https://www.similartech.com/compare/nodejs-vs-python) reported that Node.js was credited to be the most used tool in the first 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and the ‘entire’ categories of websites ranked on their popularity.

As per [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019) 2019 survey, Python was the most ‘loved’ programming language while Node.js was the most preferred tool among professional programmers.

---

Reviewing industry-wise adoptions, Node.js has been leading in Computers Electronics & Technology, Lifestyle, Arts & Entertainment, and 16 other categories according to the survey. Whereas, Python is a popular choice in industries like Science & Education, Engineering, and several others.

## Performance in Node.js vs Python

When you are scaling an application, every single bit of efficiency helps reduce the operating costs. Hence, performance and speed are considered important while assessing a programming language or environment.

#### Node.js

We have already explored Node.js non-blocking architecture. With this edge, its execution process is simpler and faster. On top of this, there is still one more perk which makes Node.js a solid contender, it executes the code outside of the web browser.

This way, the app which is running on the web-browser is processing at a faster speed and performs better on the efficiency metrics as a result. This also allows the app to pull features such as TCP sockets, which are otherwise not available in the browsers.

#### Python

Python’s innate architecture prohibits multithreading and is a problem in this aspect as well. It slows down the processing speed as processes don’t run parallelly. While Python’s syntax is easy to learn and execute, it is not fast enough for applications that frequently recall data from the web server.

---

Python’s syntax is easy to learn, but it’s not optimized for speed and performance. Node.js is the clear winner here too.

## Community in Node.js vs Python

A community is a group of users and developers engaging with the technology. Since they are active, they would keep updating the popular libraries, run debugging exercises, and even add new features. Generally, the most effective communities are the ones that are managed by a singular, dedicated organization for the language/programming environment.

#### Node’s Community

You may look at Node.js as a relatively newer form of technology and might presume its community to be small. However, you’d be surprised to learn that Node.js community is quite large and globally active with experienced [Node.js Developers](https://www.simform.com/hire/node-js-developers/). It’s super easy to discover talent in the Node.js circles.

#### Python’s Community

Python, being the older language of the two, naturally has a larger community. From junior to senior-level contributors, Python doesn’t have a dearth of talent. One of the biggest advantages of such a sizable community is the ease to find developers. And active participation from these developers results in swift solutions and overall improvement of the language.

## When is it better to use Node.js over Python

Node.js is the runtime environment that is ideal for applications that require a consistent connection between the server and the browser-side app.

An easy way to think about the need for Node.js in an application is by ranking the real-time feature for the app. If real-time data transmission is critical to the app’s usability, Node.js is exactly what you need.

It’s also noteworthy that Node.js can be used between both the server and client side. This will reduce the deployment time and make it feasible for teams to maintain the code while they coordinate.

Owing to its efficient processing, Node.js is the go-to platform used by companies that have frequent interactions between the cloud server and the client-side application. Netflix, LinkedIn, **Medium**, Trello, and Paypal are some well-known tech companies which use Node.js for their platform.

## When is it better to use Python over Node.js

Python has an extensive availability of talent partly because it runs on an uncomplicated syntax. So there’s no surprise that Google and Facebook, two of the largest technology-talent consumers, extensively use Python to build technologies.

Moreover, some of the most popular data-science training courses use Python as the default language taught to students. As a result, the availability of Python talent is increasing.

Further, Python’s popularity makes it a strategically important language to learn and use. Its rich libraries allow you to build and deploy an MVP very efficiently. This also ensures that developer resources are optimally utilized.

There’s more! The Python interpreter- responsible to execute the code- is super effective. It doesn’t need compilation, and this makes Python the ideal language for rapid deployment and iterations.

## Conclusion

Choosing between Node.js and Python can be tricky especially when you want to develop a full-flagged product and not just a side-project. The features and benefits on both sides can be overwhelming and can cloud your judgement.

This is why, the ideal way to deal with this dilemma is by focusing on the end use of your product. List out all the features of your product, and how you plan to engineer them. And the language or runtime environment that proves more handy should be your pick.
