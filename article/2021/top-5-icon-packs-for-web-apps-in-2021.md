# Top 5 Icon Packs for Web Apps in 2021

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*uPK9UAnb1ni6GDB690LYig.jpeg)

Over the past decade, web and mobile applications have become a part of our day to day lives. Today, we can find many applications solving the same problem. Therefore, it’s clear that the functionality of an app isn’t the only differentiator anymore.

Besides, the overall user experience given by the application plays a significant role in the success of these apps. To fulfill that, we also need better User Interfaces (UI).

As developers, we must ensure the look and feel of the application meets higher standards to attract new users and retain existing ones. I hope these facts convince you regarding the importance of UI design.

> When it comes to UI design, the Icons we use reflects its personality.

## Icon Packs

Icons might be small in size, but provide a strong message to end-users, even without a single word of text. When it comes to Icons, we can either use Icon Packs, which are readily available, or build the icons independently. However, I would recommend going for Icon Packs for the following reasons.

* Icon Packs help you to maintain a unique appearance throughout the application.
* It saves you time because you don’t need to build icons from scratch.
* Most importantly, you can personalize your application by selecting a subset of icons that most users are already familiar with.
* If you have an application suit, you can use these Icon Packs across the applications.

In this article, I will discuss the usage, pros, and cons of some of the best Icon Packs available out there.

## 1. ICONS8

[Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons) is one of the most popular Icon Packs among designers and developers. It provides more than 140000 icons covering around 35 different categories you need.

Finding the best icon combination for your project is one of the most hectic and time-consuming tasks for you. With Icons8, you can choose a style and instantly get a monster Icon Pack to get started. You can also customize them by adding outlines, different colors, text effects, without wasting your precious time.

Besides, Icons8 eliminates the blurring effects by providing pixel-perfect icons for your project while allowing you to download them in any standard format, including PNG, SVG, Embedded HTML, and PDF.

#### Main Features of Icons8

* Not all Icons require Attribution.
* Complete customization before download.
* You can find cons in any color, size, and format.
* Different icon styles are available. (filled icons, line icons, full icons, etc.)
* Freemium service. There are different plans for Icons, Photos, Illustrations to select as you wish from 13$ onwards.
* The free package includes PNG icons up to 100 pixels. You need to change to a paid package to download other formats and sizes.

**Cons**

* Need to register to download icons.
* You have to double-check before downloading icons and using them in your projects since some icons require Attribution.

## 2. Flaticon

[Flaticon ](https://www.flaticon.com/home)is another famous Icon Pack that we can use for design purposes, and it provides more than 2 million different icons as free and premium packages. Like Icons8, you can edit Flaticon icons before downloading them. However, Flaticon does not offer rich editing options like Icons8.

On the other hand, you can download PNG versions of the icons up to 512-pixel resolution. As I mentioned before, Flaticon also includes both free and paid versions where users can access an extensive collection of icons in the premium version.

If you are a guest user in Flaticon, you can only create a single collection and download only 10 icons per day. You can expand it up to 3 collections and 100 icons per day by registering with Flaticon without incurring any cost. Most importantly, their premium version allows you to create unlimited icon collections and download 2000 icons per day.

**Cons**

* Need to provide Attribution when using the free version.

## 3. Font Awesome

![Source: [https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3746/1*EIJXAiWtSbQW-JuFOpczSQ.png)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is yet another popular Icon Pack among the developers mainly because of its direct support to Bootstrap and CSS. However, Font Awesome has fewer icons than Icons8 and Flaticon. Since Font Awesome is the default icon set used in the Bootstrap CSS Framework, it becomes a default choice for anyone who uses Bootstrap.

If we go into details, there are two packages in Font Awesome named as free and pro. The free package only contains 1,598 icons, while the pro package includes an extra 6,250 icons and many other features.

Since Font Awesome, as the name implies, uses fonts instead of images, it provides pixel-perfect icons, easy CSS styling, hosted kits, power transforms, and easy upgrades in both these packages. Font Awesome doesn’t offer any editing options like Icons8 or Flaticoin, but it gives CSS classes for you, which can directly define in HTML.

With the free package, you can only download a Solid version of the Icon you choose, and if you wish for more variations like Regular, Light, or Duotone, you need to switch for the standard package.

#### Main Features of Font Awesome

* Attribution is no longer required as of Font Awesome 3.0.
* Supports CSS & Bootstrap.
* Provides CSS class, Unicode & SVG formats.
* You can directly change the basic properties(colors, shadows, background, etc.) of the Icons using pure CSS.
* It can easily upgrade to the latest versions.
* Font Awesome global CDN and caching are available to load icons faster.
* The standard package costs 99$ per year, including Auto-Subsetting, Human Tech Support, Pro Asset Downloads, Standard Pro License, and many other features.

## 4. Fontisto

Unlike the other three Icon Packs we discussed, [Fontisto](https://fontisto.com/) is an entirely free vector Icon Pack you can use for your development and design purposes. You can customize the icons with just a few clicks from their website. Adding spinning effects, animations, borders are some easy modifications you can do with Fontisto.

## Conclusion

The above Icon Packs are only a subset of many available packages on the internet and popular due to their adoption and rich feature sets. However, being a famous Icon Pack is just one attribute while choosing an Icon Pack. It would be best if you always consider the suitability, ease of upgrading, and how quickly you can start your project using the selected Icon Pack.

Also, it is essential to decide whether you are going to purchase icons or just going to stick with the free icons since you might need to consider Attribution for some of them. Customizability and available formats are other vital aspects of these packages, and most of the time, each Icon Pack contains its unique design categories like material, vector, CSS, SVG, etc.

So, think about the knowledge gathered from this article before selecting an Icon Pack for your project. I’m sure it will make your work process much more manageable.
