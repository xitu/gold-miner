# Here’s a list of technologies I wasted time learning as a Web Developer

#### Don’t make the same mistakes I made.

When I started learning Web Development back in 2015, I wasted a lot of time learning whatever technologies I came across in articles and tutorials online.

In an industry with an ever growing number of technologies, libraries, and frameworks, being efficient with your learning is key. So whether you’re new to Web Development, or you already have some skin in the game, here’s a list of things that I either wasted my time learning and never actually used in my professional career, or are things that are no longer relevant in 2021 (ie, you can get away with not knowing).

#### Ruby / Ruby-on-rails

Ruby-on-Rails was big in the late 2000s. I wasted several months trying to build applications with Ruby-on-Rails. While some big tech companies will still have some Rails code in their codebase, I’ve rarely come across any companies in recent years making use of it. In fact, six years into my professional career and I’ve not once had to use Rails. And even more so, I wouldn’t want to.

#### AngularJS

Not to be confused with Angular. AngularJS was replaced with Angular from version 2 onwards. Don’t bother wasting your time learning AngularJS for this reason, you’ll find very few companies using it today.

#### jQuery

jQuery is still the most popular JavaScript library, but this is more a technicality rather than by relevance (ie a lot of old websites made 10–15 years ago still make use of it). In recent years, a lot of big tech companies have shifted their code away from using jQuery in favour of regular JavaScript. A lot of the benefits that jQuery used to provide are not as relevant as they used to be (such as writing code that works on all types of browsers — this used to be more of a problem back in the day when browsers had very different specs).

#### Ember

The fire went out on ember a long time ago. If you need to pick up a JavaScript library, reach for React (or maybe Vue.js).

#### React class components

If you’re using React at work, you might still find some React class components lying around. Therefore, it’s probably still nice to have an understanding of how they work and their lifecycle methods. But if you’re writing new React components, you should be using functional components with React hooks.

#### PHP

Lord give me strength. PHP isn’t that bad, to be fair. I did have to use it quite a bit in my first web developer job (along with Laravel). But nowadays, web developers should aim to be more efficient with learning by reaching for Node.js. If you’re already learning JavaScript, why add a server side language on top such as PHP, when you can now use JavaScript on the server?

#### Deno

Deno is new, and it could be big in years to come. However, don’t fall for the hype just yet. Few companies are using Deno today. Therefore, if you’re new to Web Development, just go ahead and learn Node.js (aka server-side JavaScript). Deno could be something you choose to learn in the coming years though.

#### And there’s plenty more!

## Conclusion

So that’s my shortlist of technologies I wouldn’t bother with today. I’m sure there are plenty more than can be added to the list — feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments. I’m sure there will also be some debate over the technologies listed here — Ruby developers are easily frustrated. You’re welcome to debate that in the comments too. It’s all just opinions, right?
