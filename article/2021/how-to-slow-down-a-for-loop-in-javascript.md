# How To Slow Down A For-Loop in JavaScript

For loops are indispensable. They help us to program sequences. But there is one problem with them — the for loop runs through as fast as possible. If we iterate through an array, this is, of course, desirable.

But if we do, e.g., requests in the loop, this can lead to problems. It would be nice if each loop's execution takes a fixed time interval — for example, one pass per second.

I will show you how to do this — here is how to time a for-loop.

## First — how it does not work

If you’re looking for a direct solution to your problem, feel free to skip this part. If you want to learn something about JS, then stay for a moment. 
I want to explain why common solutions don’t work.

Thanks to setTimeout,d we can specify that a certain code should be executed only after x-time. This sounds like the solution to our problem. Just put the timeout in the for-loop, and the loop is less fast:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i)
  }, 1000)
}
```

When we run the code with **setTimeout**, the following happens: 
nothing happens for 1 second; then all the logs come up in a flash. 
Not really what we had hoped for.

The reason for this is a small error in thinking. It seems like the timeout doesn’t apply to every element — yes, it does.

But we forget how JavaScript executes code. The loop creates all timeouts immediately, not sequentially. Of course, this is very fast — so all timeouts have almost the same **start time**. 

As soon as the time is up, the logs are made — all at once.

We see the same effect when we rewrite the code minimally.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {}, 1000)
  console.log(i)
}
```

From the idea, this would work in some other programming languages. The loop starts to create the timeout. Only when it has been executed does it continue — at least in other programming languages. In JavaScript, however, the timeout is created, and the code continues to execute immediately. So JavaScript creates two flows that run parallel.

## How to slow down the for-loop properly

So with a **setTimeout**, it does not work as it should. 

The rescue is a simple promise.

```js
const sleep = (time) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    return setTimeout(function () {
      resolve()
    }, time)
  })
}
```

We call the Promise via a function. It gets the time in milliseconds that the **setTimeout** should receive. All the timeout does after the time expires is to execute the resolve function. This means the promise is fulfilled — it can continue. We can simplify the code shown above:

```js
const sleep = (time) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time))
}
```

The Promise is ready. Now we can add it to our for-loop:

```js
const sleep = (time) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, time))
}

const doSomething = async () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    await sleep(1000)
    console.log(i)
  }
}

doSomething()
```

The log is executed once per second. So to output all numbers of the loop, we need 100 seconds. So we have successfully slowed down our for-loop.
