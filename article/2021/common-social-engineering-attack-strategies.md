随着技术的飞速发展，我们在日常生活中面临的网络威胁数量也将随之增加。我们当前的时代有时也被称为“数据时代”。网络上充斥着如此多的数据，有些专家甚至将数据视为另一种形式的财富。当事情涉及财富时，坏人就会由此出现。

这些网络犯罪分子试图以某种方式访问这些数据并利用它们为自己谋取利益。 这些形式千变万化，从赎金到甚至使用数据导致混乱。

网络犯罪分子利用多种方法来给公司和个人制造问题，其中一种方法被称为社会工程。 让我们来看看这是什么。

## 什么是社会工程？

尽管“社会工程”一词听起来像是工程师的某种社会，但它指的是其他东西。社会工程学是操纵人类心理以完成恶意任务的艺术。社会工程在此过程中不涉及任何类型的技术黑客攻击。

在典型的黑客攻击场景中，黑客试图通过识别和利用网络中的漏洞来访问公司网络。但是在社会工程攻击中，攻击者会试图操纵员工以泄露敏感信息，攻击者可以利用这些信息来执行各种操作。

如今，社会工程攻击变得越来越普遍，攻击者更专注于寻找欺骗员工的新方法。社会工程攻击不是件简单的事情。首先，攻击者会选择他们的目标，监视他们的活动，并发现任何形式的心理弱点。然后攻击者试图通过利用它来获得员工的信任。一旦员工掉入陷阱，攻击者就会采取下一步的行动。

你可以在你的组织中拥有最好的安全协议，但熟练的社交工程师可以找到方法，绕过你设下的高端的安全措施，并且仍然能设法发起攻击。 即使是最大的科技公司，也发生过了无数次的社会工程攻击。 我们将在下面查看其中的一些例子。

## 主要针对哪些人？

社会工程学攻击主要针对价值高的组织的员工。 攻击者不会浪费时间利用小型企业，而是会尝试针对大型公司，有时甚至是政府，以造成最大的破坏。

多项调查显示，新员工最容易受到社会工程攻击，因为他们还没有为此类攻击做好心理准备。这些攻击手段非常复杂，以至于在造成损害之前你永远不会意识到自己正在被操纵。

让我们来看看最常用的攻击技术。

## Most Commonly Used Attack Techniques

### Phishing

Phishing is one of the most commonly used social engineering attack techniques. Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to extract sensitive information through the means of email or text messages by posing as a legitimate person.

Phishing attacks are mostly targeting a huge number of people and there is no single specific target point. Think of it as **Fishing**, where you do not try to catch a specific fish, but rather try to catch any fish. Therefore these phishing campaigns are done in bulk, in order to reach a large number of unsuspecting individuals.

An example of a phishing attack would be an email sent to users highlighting that their PayPal accounts are being blocked due to suspicious behavior. This creates a sense of panic amongst the recipients causing them to not think twice before clicking the links in the email. Once these links have been clicked, you will be redirected to a “**spoof”** website that will look exactly similar to PayPal with a near-identical URL as well. Once you submit the account credentials, the attacker will have access to your credentials as well. Another possible scenario would be that malware would be downloaded once you click on the link and it will execute itself on your local system.

Since Phishing attacks are done in bulk targeting many users, it is easy for mail servers to detect and block these types of attacks before they cause trouble for the end-user.

### Spear Phishing

Spear Phishing is a more targeted version of Phishing where an attacker targets a selected employee or company. This form of attack requires a huge effort from the attacker and can even take several months of planning and preparation. The attacker needs to gather personal information regarding his subjects such as job, personality, characteristics, and even contacts. Once these are collected, the attacker sends a message via email, or text messages similar to Phishing, but these messages are tailormade to each target, making them look less obvious.

These types of attacks are the most successful ones if executed flawlessly. Since they are only sent in small numbers, it is hard for mail servers to detect and block these types of attacks.

### Baiting

Baiting is an attack that uses a false promise to trigger the victim’s greed or curiosity and using it to the attacker’s advantage. Its main characteristic is the promise of goods that hackers use to deceive the victims. The attacker either steals the sensitive information or forces malware onto the unsuspecting victim’s device.

Baiting attacks are done in the form of physical and online attacks. In a physical attack, a malware-infected device will be kept in a publicly accessible area where potential victims are known to hang around. These devices will look very authentic and will contain labeling that denotes something very interesting.

An example scenario would be where an attacker leaves a malware-infected pen drive on a common area accessible to the victim. This pen drive would be labeled as something irresistible like high performing clients of the company, or some pornographic material. Once the victim plugs this device onto their computer, the malware infects the host and allows the attacker to take action.

In case of an online attack, the victim will be baited with a “too good to be true” ad that seduces them and leads to malicious sites or encourages users to download a malware-infected application.

### Quid Pro Quo

Quid Pro Quo can be identified as a variant of Baiting. Quid pro quo is a Latin phrase used in English to mean an exchange of services. Instead of promised goods, this form of attack will promise a service or an action from the attackers’ end.

One of the most common Quid Pro Quo attacks is when attackers impersonate the US Social Security Administration(SSA). These imposters contact unsuspecting individuals and ask them to confirm their social security number citing technical reasons. Once this has been done, the attackers can easily perform identity theft.

In other cases found by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), fraudulent actors have set up bogus SSA websites that claim they can help people register for new Social Security cards but actually steal their personal details.

### Pretexting

Pretexting is a social engineering attack technique that mainly involves the manipulation of a victim solely based on the trust built. Attackers present themselves usually as someone who has a right-to-know authority like co-workers, police, bank, and tax officials. The attacker then asks questions under the pretext of confirming the victim’s identity and then uses sensitive information for their own use.

Although these attackers mostly gather only personal data, there have been events where attackers have gained security information related to a physical plant.

The success of this form of attack heavily depends on the level of trust the attacker was able to build with their victims. Many sophisticated types of pretexting attacks attempt to trick the victims into an action that allows the attacker to find and exploit a point of vulnerability within an enterprise.

### Scareware

Scareware is a type of attack where the victim gets bombarded with popups and emails with false alarms and fictitious threats. These are very common and the least effective. You probably would have seen popups with the text “Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs” on several websites. Once you click on these links, you will either be directed to install a “malware removal” application which itself would contain malware or will direct you to a malicious site where your computer becomes infected.

The other type of scareware is pretty commonly found in your email spam box. Your spam box will be filled with emails from senders promising “too good to be true” offers or bogus threats. Your mail server would probably do a good job identified and isolating these emails, and therefore this form of attack is amongst the least effective.

Social Engineering attackers use several strategies to implement their attacks successfully. One of the most common strategies is to **offer something irresistible**. This strategy will exploit human greed to achieve the desired outcome. Another common strategy would be to **fake it till you make it**. This strategy involves playing the victim card and eventually making the employee believing in your story. **Showing your level of authority** is also another strategy used by attackers when impersonating someone. As people tend to respect people with **authority** — or show **authority**, this trick works most of the time.

## Most Notable Social Engineering Attacks in History

### Facebook and Google

Both [Facebook and Google were scammed](http://fortune.com/2017/04/27/facebook-google-rimasauskas/) over 100 million USD in a span of over 2 years. A Lithuanian hacker was able to send fake invoices impersonating an Asian vendor of these two companies. This is known as one of the costliest Phishing attacks.

### Barbara Corcoran — Shark Tank

Shark Tank judge Barbara almost got caught in a social engineering attack which [would have cost her a staggering 400,000 USD](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/how-barbara-corcoran-almost-lost-400000-dollars-to-an-email-scam.html). An attacker had impersonated her assistant and contacted her bookkeeper requesting a payment for the renewal of her real estate investments. The attacker had used an email address very similar to the legitimate assistant’s. This fraud was detected when the bookkeeper had contacted the assistant regarding the wire transfer.

Although the money had left Barbara’s account, they were able to freeze the transaction before it reached the attacker’s account in China.

### Toyota

Toyota Boshoku Corporation is a Japanese automotive component manufacturer. It is a member of the Toyota Group of companies. They were the victims of a [social engineering attack in 2019](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2019/09/06/toyota-parts-supplier-hit-by-37-million-email-scam/). They lost around 37 million USD. It is still not known whether Toyota was able to recover the lost money. The attacker was able to convince someone with financial authority to change account information on an electronic funds transfer.

### Ethereum Classic

The [Ethereum Classic website was hacked in 2017](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ethereum-classic-wallet-a-victim-of-social-engineering) making users lose thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. The social engineering attackers were able to impersonate the owner of the website and gain access to its domain registry. Once they received the access, they redirected the domain to their own server. The attackers were later able to extract the cryptocurrency from the victims after viewing their private transactions.

### Sony Pictures

This social engineering attack was one of the biggest topics during its time. Sony Pictures [was under attack in 2014](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/12/18/the-sony-pictures-hack-explained/) where it had lost several important documents including business agreements, financial documents, and employees’ information. It was later identified that this attack was a spearfishing attack and the targeted employees were lured using Apple product emails.

## How to Stay Safe as an Individual?

* Do not open emails and attachments from suspicious sources. Always make sure to check the email address of the sender. Even an email address from a trusted sender can be spoofed.
* Use multifactor authentication. Attackers are very interested in your login credentials. But if you use multifactor authentication, the attacker will not able to do anything with your credentials alone.
* Be careful about “too good to be true” offers. If an offer sounds too good to be true, do a bit of Googling regarding that topic to get an idea on whether the offer is legitimate.
* Keep your antivirus up to date.
* Always keep your device locked when not in use.
* Always be cautious when talking with people. Think before you speak. You might unintentionally say something that may be confidential.

## How to Stay Safe as an Organization?

According to Dan Lohrmann,

* Focus on training your employees, especially the new hires. Ensure that there is a comprehensive security awareness training program in place that is regularly updated to address both the general phishing threats and the new targeted cyber threats. Remember, this is not just about clicking on links.
* Keep regular “roadshow” briefings explaining the latest attack trends. Make sure all levels of employees attend these briefings, including senior executives and those who have authority over financial transactions.
* Hire external independent security teams to audit your company security. These audits should happen regularly.

It is essential that we maintain proper security practices to avoid ourselves and our companies from getting into trouble. As we have seen above, these attacks can be very costly. It is up to us to stay safe from all the nasty eyes around us.
