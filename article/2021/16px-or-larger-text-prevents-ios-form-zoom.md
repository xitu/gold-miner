# 16px or Larger Text Prevents iOS Form Zoom

This was a great [“Today I Learned” for me from Josh W. Comeau](https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau/status/1379782931116351490?s=12). If the `font-size` of an `<input>` is 16px or larger, Safari on iOS will focus into the input normally. But as soon as the `font-size` is 15px or less, the viewport will zoom into that input. Presumably, because it considers that type too small and wants you to see what you are doing. So it zooms in to help you. Accessibility. If you don’t want that, make the font big enough.

[Here’s Josh’s exact Pen](https://codepen.io/joshwcomeau/pen/VwPMPZo) if you want to have a play yourself.

In general, I’d say I like this feature. It helps people see what they are doing and discourages super-tiny font sizes. What is a slight bummer — and I really don’t blame anyone here — is that not all typefaces are created equal in terms of readability at different sizes. For example, here’s San Francisco versus Caveat at 16px.

<small>San Francisco on the left, Cavet on the right. Caveat looks visually much smaller even though the `font-size` is the same.</small>

You can view [that example](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/MWJxXWz) in [Debug Mode](https://cdpn.io/chriscoyier/debug/MWJxXWz) to see for yourself and change the font size to see what does and doesn’t zoom.

> When Safari zooms in, it seems to aim for an effective 16px font size. In both clips, the user is seeing 16px input text as they type. So we're not actually making the inputs harder to read with this change!
