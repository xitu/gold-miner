Hello everyone, hope you are doing great! In this short article, I am writing about 6 free tools that save me a lot of time when I am building websites. I hope you will also find these tools helpful. let's get into the article.

## 1. [Type Scale](https://type-scale.com/)

Do you often struggle to define the perfect font sizes for your elements? If yes then this is the perfect tool for you.

All you have to do is add your base font size once you do that this tool will generate different font sizes for different elements.(H1,H2,H3 etc.)  
Also, you can select different fonts from google fonts and try different scales for your font size.

The best feature of this tool is you can literally copy the CSS generated according to your choices and paste it into your CSS file. It also imports the font you selected and sets the `font-family` for your html. Then you don't have to define font sizes everywhere!
