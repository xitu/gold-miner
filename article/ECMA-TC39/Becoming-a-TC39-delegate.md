# Becoming a TC39 delegate

TC39 is a part of [Ecma International](http://www.ecma-international.org/). Ecma membership is based on organizations, not individuals. To participate in physical TC39 meetings, join Ecma as a member organization or attend as a delegate of an existing member organization.

## Joining Ecma

Ecma has [several membership tiers](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/join.htm), including a free tier for not-for-profit organizations and various paid tiers based on company size. To join Ecma,
- Fill out the [form](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/join.htm) appropriate to your membership tier.
- Sign [the royalty-free patent agreement](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Registration%20Form%20for%20the%20Ecma%20Royalty%20Free%20(RF)%20Patent%20Policy.pdf) required for TC39.
- Forms may be sent either by email to [the Secretary General](mailto:istvan@ecma-international.org) or by mail to

The Secretary General

Ecma International

Rue du Rhône 114

CH-1204 Geneva

Switzerland

- When the Ecma secretariat receives and verifies your form submissions, you'll be able to participate in TC39 activities as members do, though things are formalized some months later.
- Membership fees are paid annually, starting at the end of the joining year.

## Attending TC39 as a delegate of a member company

Find the meeting locations, dates and agendas in [the agenda repository](https://github.com/tc39/agendas/). The agenda links to various documents about all of the proposals that will be discussed.

Ecma and TC39 don't set a limit on who attends TC39 from a member organization, but many member organizations coordinate internally with respect to TC39. If you're not the first person in your organization to attend TC39, contact others before attending the meeting to learn more.

Before attending a meeting, be sure to sign the meeting's Doodle that is sent out to all delegates.

If your organization does not have the right to license the intellectual property that you would contribute to Ecma (most employers do have such an agreement), then sign [the contributor IP form](https://tc39.es/agreements/contributor/).
