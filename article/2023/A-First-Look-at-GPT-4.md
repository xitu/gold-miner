## What is this about?

This is blog post is about the first few tests I ran with the [new GPT-4 model](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4). Spoiler alert: It’s impressive!

## Chain of thought reasoning

Let’s start with the title image. In this case we ask GPT-4 a very convoluted question that requires multiple chains of reasoning. Not only does it get the answer right, it also provides its reasoning step by step!

## Logical fallacy

In the next one I try to trick GPT-4, and I already thought “Hah, gotcha!” when it non-chalantly added a sneaky footnote into the response 😂

## Logic / math — part 1

This type of question ChatGPT got wrong many times, but GPT-4 is very unimpressed by my attempt to trick it:

## Logic / math — part 2

## _Logic / math — part 3 (with bonus points for the movie question)_

This one blew my mind!

## AWS exam question — part 1

That’s correct!

## AWS exam question — part 2

Also … correct … Wait, am I out of a job now???

## Creating a sample architecture for a photo-sharing website

Yup, I’m _definitely_ out of a job …

## Coding

I wonder if I can just let GPT-4 do my job and not tell anyone … 🤪 Can anyone confirm if this is correct, by the way?

## NLP

Of course it gets that one right 🙃

## Current events

It still has the knowledge cutoff from September 2021, tho. But the geography part is correct, I believe (geo was never my strong suit …)?

## Conclusion

This model is something else, I believe. And we haven’t even explored the multimodal aspects of it. I will obviously stay up all night to experiment more and might update this blog post from time to time 😊
