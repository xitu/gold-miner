We all want to be more productive and efficient in our daily lives, but sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start. Fortunately, with the help of ChatGPT, an AI-powered conversational agent, you can develop strategies to improve your productivity and achieve your goals. Here are some ideas on how to use ChatGPT to change your life:

## [](https://dev.to/opendataanalytics/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-improve-your-productivity-5-examples-39lj#1-set-smart-goals-with-chatgpt)1\. Set SMART goals with ChatGPT

Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals is a great way to stay focused and motivated. ChatGPT can help you identify and set SMART goals that align with your values and priorities.

For example, you can insert the following prompt into ChatGPT:

> I want to improve my fitness. I need very specific, achievable goals that subscribes to the SMART goals method. Give me a plan with the best quality and in a table format. The table should be in markdown code.

ChatGPT responds:

| Goal | Specifics | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time-bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. Increase cardiovascular endurance | Run for 30 minutes without stopping | Time and distance covered | Gradually increase duration and intensity | Important for overall health | Achieve in 12 weeks |
| 2\. Increase muscular strength | Perform 10 push-ups without rest | Number of repetitions | Consistent practice and proper form | Enhance daily activities and prevent injury | Achieve in 6 weeks |
| 3\. Improve flexibility | Touch toes without bending knees | Distance between hands and feet | Stretch regularly and maintain healthy diet | Enhance range of motion and reduce muscle tension | Achieve in 8 weeks |
| 4\. Decrease body fat percentage | Lose 1 pound of body fat per week | Weight and body fat percentage | Consistently maintain a caloric deficit and exercise regularly | Improve overall health and appearance | Achieve in 12 weeks |

-   Increase cardiovascular endurance: The goal is to run for 30 minutes without stopping. This will be measured by tracking the time and distance covered during each run. Gradual increases in duration and intensity will make this goal achievable. Cardiovascular endurance is important for overall health. This goal will be achieved within 12 weeks.
    
-   Increase muscular strength: The goal is to perform 10 push-ups without rest. This will be measured by the number of repetitions completed. Consistent practice and proper form will make this goal achievable. Increasing muscular strength will enhance daily activities and prevent injury. This goal will be achieved within 6 weeks.
    
-   Improve flexibility: The goal is to touch toes without bending knees. This will be measured by the distance between hands and feet. Regular stretching and maintaining a healthy diet will make this goal achievable. Improving flexibility will enhance range of motion and reduce muscle tension. This goal will be achieved within 8 weeks.
    
-   Decrease body fat percentage: The goal is to lose 1 pound of body fat per week. This will be measured by tracking weight and body fat percentage. Consistently maintaining a caloric deficit and exercising regularly will make this goal achievable. Decreasing body fat percentage will improve overall health and appearance. This goal will be achieved within 12 weeks.
    

## [](https://dev.to/opendataanalytics/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-improve-your-productivity-5-examples-39lj#2-prioritize-your-tasks-with-chatgpt)2\. Prioritize your tasks with ChatGPT

Prioritizing your tasks is essential for staying productive and on track. ChatGPT can help you identify your most important tasks and create a plan for tackling them.

As an example, make the following request to ChatGPT:

> I need to finish a report, respond to some emails, and schedule a meeting. Generate me a table and show me how to identify your most important tasks and create a plan for tackling them. Must be specific, with precise and executable timetable.

ChatGPT responds:

| Task | Importance | Urgency | Deadline | Action Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Finish report | High | High | EOD today | Block off two hours of uninterrupted time in the morning to focus on the report. Break down the report into smaller, manageable sections and allocate time for each section. Take a break after each section to prevent burnout. Review and edit the report at the end of the day. |
| Respond to emails | Medium | High | Within 24 hours | Schedule 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon to respond to emails. Prioritize urgent emails and respond to them first. Set up filters to categorize and prioritize incoming emails. Set an autoresponder to manage expectations and prevent email overload. |
| Schedule a meeting | High | Medium | Within 48 hours | Identify potential meeting times based on availability of participants. Use a scheduling tool to send out invitations and confirm availability. Set a clear agenda for the meeting and share it with all participants in advance. Follow up after the meeting with action items and next steps. |

1.  Finish report: The report is high importance and high urgency, with a deadline of end of day today. The action plan is to block off two hours of uninterrupted time in the morning to focus on the report, break it down into smaller, manageable sections, allocate time for each section, take a break after each section to prevent burnout, and review and edit the report at the end of the day.
    
2.  Respond to emails: Responding to emails is of medium importance but high urgency, with a deadline of within 24 hours. The action plan is to schedule 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon to respond to emails, prioritize urgent emails, set up filters to categorize and prioritize incoming emails, and set an autoresponder to manage expectations and prevent email overload.
    
3.  Schedule a meeting: Scheduling a meeting is of high importance and medium urgency, with a deadline of within 48 hours. The action plan is to identify potential meeting times based on availability of participants, use a scheduling tool to send out invitations and confirm availability, set a clear agenda for the meeting and share it with all participants in advance, and follow up after the meeting with action items and next steps.
    

## [](https://dev.to/opendataanalytics/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-improve-your-productivity-5-examples-39lj#3-create-a-routine-with-chatgpt)3\. Create a routine with ChatGPT

Creating a daily routine can help you establish good habits and stay on track. ChatGPT can help you develop a routine that works for your lifestyle and goals.

Ask ChatGPT with the following line:

> Based on the daily tasks and routine I give you above, generate a markdown table that help me establish good habits and stay on track. Create a daily routine that includes exercise. I prefer to exercise in the morning, but I struggle to wake up early.

ChatGPT responds:

| Time | Task | Action Plan |

## [](https://dev.to/opendataanalytics/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-improve-your-productivity-5-examples-39lj#5automate-your-tasks-with-chatgpt)5.Automate your tasks with ChatGPT

You can try to automate your tasks with ChatGPT to make your workflow more efficient. For example, you can automate troubleshooting with ChatGPT. ChatGPT can help you troubleshoot issues in your code by providing suggestions on how to fix them.

For example, you are having the following error code:  

```
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
```

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

You can simply copy and paste the error message into the chatbot prompt and ask for help. ChatGPT will make the following responce:

> This error occurs when you're trying to use an integer as a function. Here are some steps to troubleshoot the issue:
> 
> -   Check the code where the error occurred: Look at the line of code where the error occurred and see if you're trying to use an integer as a function.
>     
> -   Check the variables: Make sure that any variables you're using in the code are declared and initialized properly.
>     
> -   Check the function call: If you're calling a function, make sure that you're using the correct syntax and that the function is defined properly.
>     
> -   Check for typos: Make sure that there are no typos or syntax errors in the code.
>     
> 
> In this case, the error message suggests that the issue is related to a function call. Double check to see if you're trying to use an integer as a function or if there are any syntax errors or typos in the code. You may need to redefine the variable or use a different function to resolve the error.

If you want ChatGPT to identify the exact issue, you can provide it the context by copying and pasting your code into the ChatGPT prompt. Keep in mind that you only want to do this when you are the owner of the code. If you are under an contract with disclosure restrictions from a software company, **DO NOT copy and paste your entire code into ChatGPT**!

Besides manually copy and paste prompts for ChatGPT, another trick is using automated tools that can save your time. You can use:

-   [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com/) for programming automation.
-   [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for Python Web scraping automation.
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing automation.
-   [RATH](https://kanaries.net/) for automated data analysis and visualization
