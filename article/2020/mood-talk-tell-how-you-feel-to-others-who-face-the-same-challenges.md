# UX Case Study: Mood Talk — A mental health app

> Mood Talk — Tell how you feel to others who face the same challenges

In the world lots of people face some sort of mental problem, such as **loneliness, insomnia, depression, stress, anxiety or personal disorders.** Unfortunately the list of possibilities was not finished at all.

Wouldn’t be nice, if you could talk to **people who face or already gone trough** these same exact problems, know how you feel and able to give actually helpful, legit advices on how to overcome these terrible situations? I think it would be super great. In fact, I was thinking that it would be so 
excellent , that I created an app design which tends to solve that exact problem.

## Context

As a part of my design school I was challenged to create an application within the **topic of Wellness**. I believe that **connection is the key to** most of our **problems**. Indeed to have precious connections is one of our biggest assets in life, either we think about **personal relations** or **networks**, which help us get better positions in our carrier, or just in life in general.

That was my main thought process when I decided that I’m going to work on a project where **my goal is to try make people**, who faces mental disorders, a **little bit happier**. Or, what would be even better, to **“talk them out” from their rough situation.**

## Research & findings

#### Surveys

Eventually I managed to collect **42 survey** answers. Trough my research process and these were the most important questions which I wanted to find the answer for:

* How much people faces mental issues?
* Which age group is the most affected?
* What’s the best way to solve these problems?

#### Interviews

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/7364/1*NRsq36KAGGzwcGDStpb-Nw.jpeg)

I’ve conducted **5** **interviews** to open up the topic a little bit more, to emphasise more with real people. Although I had some answers from the surveys, here I wanted to focus on the **“How it begin”** part.

It turned out that most of the time a **tragic life event** plays a the biggest roles in these cases. But sometimes even just normal things could create problems, such as, **can’t find the time to meet with friends and family** due to work or study. **Moving to a different city or country.** Moreover just simply having a **stressful, overwhelmed** life also could cause serious issues.

#### Analyse given data

On this topic numerous studies has been made already by field experts and professors from different universities. Lot of information is accessible for free, just by searching on Google.

I found a lot of information which **confirmed my previous findings**. I’ve also read a lot about the **way of prevention** and **more ways to overcome** these situations.

## My user

Carl Williams Just moved to the Netherlands because he has got a nice job offer. Unfortunately he doesn’t speak the local language, and even though at the workplace everyone can speak in English, when it comes to more personal conversations, his collages switch back to their native language, which makes it hard for Carl to assimilate socially.

After a while, since he struggles to form new relationships, he is becoming lonely. It has a high chance that it going to turn into depression soon.

> Carl who moved to The Netherlands recently, needs to find new friends and a listening community because he feels lonely

## Solution

Since It’s turned out that communication and connections are the key elements of solving the problem, I needed to find features which help the user in these actions. I brainstormed the following ideas, features for the project.

* Daily mood tracking
* Real life group events
* Private group chats
* Mood share function

While I was figuring out the possible solutions, I was keeping in mind that these features has to create connection, but at the same time I have to be aware, that some people probably wouldn’t attend a real life event at all.

## Structure

My idea was simple, a Home screen where you can see your friends latest posts. The user have the chance to also write a new post. In the navigation bar I included the real life events and the private group chats option as well.

After a lot of feedback and usability testing a lot has changed by the final version.

## Visuals

As the 1st step I analysed my main competitors applications to see what kind of colors, images and icons are they using to make their site more attractive and functional.

I wanted to find applications which operate in the same niche, connecting people to create better mood. After the visual analysis I could make some conclusions. Apps tent to use friendly, relaxing colours. They focus on the community and how to connect them which gave me a lot of inspirations to make the visuals.

## Mood board

After all I created my mood board, where I was focusing on a playful, friendly approach. Somewhat childish. I used Baloo Da 2 as my primary font, because it really matched my ideas about the visuals.

## Building a design system

Needless to say that in a real life design project, building up a real life design system would take much longer, but here we were focusing only on the essentials of the app.

## Final Appearance

And finally here is the final looks of some of the pages of the app design of the final version

## Micro animations

Since the next big step was to add micro animations to our project I would like to show how it turned out in a short video format. To create the inter actions I’ve used InVision studio.

## Summary of the project

That was my really first full project from UX to UI. If I could start over I would definitely choose a topic which is not that wide. Looking back the idea itself to solve mental disability without any field knowledge feels really bold. As a first project I’m okay with the result, but with my current knowledge I would definitely be able to do a much better work.

Since that was the first project where I needed to implement micro animations as well, it was an extra challenge, but I learned a lot about the importance of proper layer naming and proper grouping and now I see how important they are in a bigger project.
