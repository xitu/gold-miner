# Dark Theme: A Modern UI Design

![Photo by [Mathew Schwartz](https://unsplash.com/@cadop?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6500/0*-6vxFqCRAb7BkbAE)

User Experience and User Interface are the fundamental concern of any successful software. Thus, developers have identified and adopted the dark themed interfaces (as an optional theme) to serve users and help them reduce eye strain, especially in low-light or in the dark.

Dim lights are known for de-stressing and saving energy. The dark mode is a low light interface using darker colors, usually black or a shade of grey, as its primary background color. It’s an inversion of the default white UI that designers have been using for ages.

Night mode and dark themes have become an emergence in modern UI design, and many big companies like [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/iphone/account-and-profile/how-to-use-dark-mode/?lang=fb), [Instagram](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/897760233943762?helpref=search&sr=1&query=dark%20mode&search_session_id=b3d02d9c67450e4b3c3ade2ee6125d3a), [Google](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9275525?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en#:~:text=Turn%20on%20Dark%20theme,Dark%20theme%20in%20device%20settings.), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=126591948482539), and [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/dark-mode) have already adopted this new trend.

## Why dark mode?

As software engineers, one of our main goals is to embrace customer satisfaction, which mostly depends on the end-users’ experience. This means the UI should be designed and implemented with simplicity and ease.

Why people prefer dark mode:

* Increased screen time
* Reduced eye strains, in low light/dark situations
* Increases visibility in low-ambient lighting
* Fewer eye strains mean fewer headaches and better work experience.

As much as high color contrasts can improve readability, pure black and white contrasts can take more time to read by the user.

## Choosing the color palette

Pure black and pure white are not good. White is 100% and black is 0%. Therefore, such disparity creates an intense light level that overstimulates the eyes. This disturbance in the eyes provokes eye strains, and are disliked by many. Here are a few suggestions to consider when filling your color palette:

#### Avoid pure black

No books use pure black or white. This is because the direct contrast between black and white is too stark, and forces readers to squint, which eventually leads to the readers having a headache and a bad experience. Therefore, avoid using pure black as the background color.

#### Use proper contrast

The dark mode backgrounds have to be dark enough to show white text. Else, the text would be less readable by the user. [Google Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) suggests using at least a 15.8:1 text-to-background contrast ratio. Therefore, it is best to wisely contrast your color palette.

#### Use desaturated colors

Fully saturated colors “**vibrate**” when viewed on dark surfaces, hindering readability, and making it very uncomfortable. Therefore, avoid fully saturated colors. Alternate it with desaturated colors like pastels and shades that include grey and white.

#### Don’t immediately invert

To get the dark theme is **not** to simply invert the colors. Some colors in the UI possess a psychological purpose and immediate inversion of these colors could make it meaningless and absurd. Therefore, always be thoughtful about the selection of colors for your color palette.

#### Visualize the hierarchy

Using the same color for all layers hinders good UI design practice and may result in poor readability. Therefore, using lighter shades for higher layers and darkening towards the lower layers is recommended. This creates a visual hierarchy that goes from the most used elements in your display to the least.

## Suggested background colors for white text

A survey by the [American Optometric Association’s](https://www.aoa.org/?sso=y) (AOA)has found that 58% of the adult in the US have experienced eye strain from working on computers. Therefore, here are a few suggestions by [Rushabh Kulkarni](https://www.instagram.com/rushabhuix/?hl=en) from [UX Bucket](https://uxbucket.com/author/rushabh-kulkarni/) for designing dark themes.

I suggest viewing these colors in the dark mode on the Medium mobile app (beta) for better visual clarity. Sadly, dark mode is not available for the web. However, you can achieve it by installing a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-dark-mode/kofkfocgjmlajkbkecljhbalihcpliih?hl=en).

#### \#303030

[**HEX color #303030, Color name: Night Rider, RGB(48,48,48), Windows: 3158064](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/303030)

#### \#2B2B2B

[**HEX color #2B2B2B, Color name: Night Rider, RGB(43,43,43), Windows: 2829099](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/2B2B2B)

#### \#1F1F1F

[**HEX color #1F1F1F, Color name: Nero, RGB(31,31,31), Windows: 2039583](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/1F1F1F)

#### \#1B1C1E

[**HEX color #1B1C1E, Color name: Black Russian, RGB(27,28,30), Windows: 1973275](https://www.htmlcsscolor.com/hex/1B1C1E)

As you can see for yourself, these shades aren't pure black and white and are much readable. And scrolling down from #303030 to #1B1C1E, we can visualize that the background color gets deeper and darker when scrolling down.

## The dark mode is not black mode!

The above suggestions are for pure black and white. However, when it comes to dark mode, there are other color combinations too. This could be a darker shade of any color used for the background.

I'm going to skim through some of my favorite and most-used apps, and their dark mode features. Let’s quickly scroll through them, below.

#### Whatsapp

![Image Source: [https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/WhatsApp-dark-mode-official.jpg?quality=82&strip=all](https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/03/WhatsApp-dark-mode-official.jpg?quality=82&strip=all)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4000/1*YYtHVixWlaPSxbbF55IbbQ.jpeg)

Whatsapp uses a **dark green** theme that blends perfectly with the usual green theme. And in the above image, you can see how they have prioritized components on the screen based on their importance and levels of control.

#### Twitter

![Image Source: [https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/03/Twitter-black-dark-mode-iOS-iPhone-lead.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all](https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/03/Twitter-black-dark-mode-iOS-iPhone-lead.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4824/1*RKfQZYdz6-vdReyFwg5Rqg.jpeg)

Twitter uses a wonderful blend of **dark blue** with lighter shades of black. Also, notice that the priority of the components has been segmented from lighter shades to darker shades.

#### Instagram

![Image Source: [https://miro.medium.com/max/16424/1*d8-4IYqquJ0yGIKZ3bjzWg.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/16424/1*d8-4IYqquJ0yGIKZ3bjzWg.png)](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/8000/1*0Nm6mbqGpnGD8xUmtVVYrg.png)

Instagram uses a theme with more black compared to other apps. The black is compromised with darker shades of grey pushing the main controls on a higher level and content on the deeper levels.

As I have mentioned above, there are other big companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., that have introduced dark mode to their products with their preferred matching colors.

Therefore, dark mode isn't always shades of black and white. It can be different and customized to the color combination of the business, organization, or client’s preference.

## Conclusion

Technology is evolving exponentially and looking around, everyone is either using a computer or a mobile device. This validates the responsibility of us, as software engineers, to provide end-users with the best user experience.

The dark theme era has just fired up and it's the perfect time to go dark and creative! Bring in the creativity and let the results speak for themselves!

I hope this story has educated you on the factors to consider when designing dark themes in modern UI. Have fun learning and enjoy developing!
