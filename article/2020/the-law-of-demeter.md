# The Law of Demeter

![the law of Demeter](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1*Q2hIGRJoa-s-CNx9KpZPeQ.jpeg)

The law of Demeter, known as LoD or the principle of least knowledge. This so-called law has three core ideas as follows.

* Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units “closely” related to the current unit.
* Each unit should only talk to its friends; don’t talk to strangers.
* Only talk to your immediate friends.

Keep in mind that a unit in this context is a specifically coded abstraction such as possibly a function, a module, or a class. And talking here means interfacing with, such as calling the code of another module or having that other module call your code.

It is very useful to learn and apply to your program but it is sad 😔 that it often is forgotten or ignored. This law is more of a guideline than a principle to help reduce coupling between components.

We’ve all seen long chain of functions like these.

```java
obj.getX()
      .getY()
        .getZ()
          .doSomething();
```

We ask then ask before we tell anything. The call to doSomething() propagates outwards till it gets to Z. These long chains of queries violate something called the Law of Demeter. Wouldn’t it look better like as follows?

```java
obj.doSomething();
```

In other words, we can understand this law: an object should only invoke methods of these kinds of objects as follows: itself, its parameters, any objects it creates, its direct component objects, objects of the same type.

Next, let’s take some simple examples of defining `Customer` and `CustomerWallet` class.

```java
public class Customer {
    
    ...

}

public class CustomerWallet {

    private float amount = 0;

    ...

}
```

Invoke itself and its parameters.

```java
public class CustomerWallet {

    ...

    public void addMoney(float deposit) {
        this.amount += deposit;
    }

    public void takeMoney(float debit) {
       this.amount -= debit;
    }
}
```

It's okay to call methods on any objects we create or any directly held component objects.

```java
public class Customer {
    
    private CustomerWallet wallet;
    public Customer() {
        this.wallet = new CustomerWallet();
    }

}
```

Looking further. We take a simplified version of an interaction between the Shopkeeper and the Customer may go wrong as follows.

```java
public class ShopKeeper {
    public void processPurchase(Product product, Customer customer){
        static price = product.price();
        customer.wallet.takeMoney(price);
        ...
      }

}
```

It violates the laws of Demeter. We try to consider a real-life case of this interaction. The shopkeeper takes the wallet from the customer’s pocket and then proceeds to open the wallet and take the desired amount without in any way interacting with the customer directly.

It’s immediately obvious that this would never be a socially appropriate interaction in real life. In this case the shopkeeper is making assumptions outside of their remit. The customer may wish to pay using a different mechanism, or may not even have a wallet.

The shopkeeper here should not have knowledge of the customer’s wallet and so should not be talking to it. So, we should re-write our program as follows.

```java
public class ShopKeeper {
    public void processPurchase(Product product, Customer customer){
        static float price = product.price();
        customer.requestPayment(price);
        ...
    }

}

public class Customer {
    
    ...
    public requestPayment(float price) {
        ...
    }

}
```

The `ShopKeeper` is now talking to the `Customer` directly. And the customer also will talk to their `CustomerWallet` instance, retrieving the desired amount and then handing it to the shopkeeper.

Easy, right?
