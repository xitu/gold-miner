# Why You Should Make Your Code as Simple as Possible

Programming is a lot like writing ‚Äî you should start with a ‚Äú[bad first draft](https://medium.com/@jeffgoins/dont-waste-your-words-how-to-write-a-first-draft-that-is-crappy-but-usable-c5dbf977f5a5)‚Äù that solves the problem, then immediately edit it two or three times before you move on to the next problem.

Engineers scoff at being compared to measly ‚Äúwriters‚Äù ‚Äî but who wrote the documentation that you used earlier today? And don‚Äôt you ‚Äúwrite code?‚Äù

Software developers have the luxury of working in the most creative type of engineering. After all, software engineers get to call a lot more shots when building an app than civil engineers do when building a bridge.

Working in a creative profession means that you can learn a great deal from writers whose words will never execute. And one of the best pieces of writing advice is something typically recommended to solve writer‚Äôs block.

Let me introduce you to the ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù ‚Äî because it will make you a much faster coder than ever before.

## The ‚ÄúBad First Draft‚Äù Method

The idea of a ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù is so commonplace that you‚Äôve probably heard about it at some point in an English class even if you‚Äôve never gone down the rabbit hole of internet bloggers offering tips about writer‚Äôs block.

The idea of a ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù is that you just need to finish the first draft even if it completely sucks ‚Äî because any first draft is better than a blank page.

Editing your own work is easier than writing from scratch, so you need to try to write something (anything!), right now. Just make the code work.

To put it another way, would you rather have written 100 lines of bad code (that works) or zero lines of perfect code by lunch today?

Sure, at the end of the day, you may still end up with 50 lines of perfect code either way. But there‚Äôs a psychological advantage to writing a ‚Äúbad first draft:‚Äù **you‚Äôll feel more successful with less stress.**

**You‚Äôll write code and have fun doing it!** What beats that?

## How I Approach First Drafts

I prefer to think that I should aim to start with a ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù because a ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù seems to carry a negative judgment about my abilities.

Do you want to be a ‚Äúbad programmer‚Äù writing ‚Äúbad code‚Äù because you read a tip about writing a ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù?

No, you want to be a ‚Äúsuccessful programmer‚Äù writing ‚Äúgreat code‚Äù because you are following this tip about starting with a ‚Äúsimple first draft.‚Äù

If you‚Äôve ever copied a code sample and then tweaked it for your own use, then you‚Äôve actually already done the ‚Äúsimple first draft.‚Äù

When using a code sample, you inevitably change things quite a bit, but the key is to get it working first and then immediately improve upon it.

You can use the concept of a ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù to complete any programming task ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre brand new to coding or already an expert.

## Why the ‚ÄúSimple First Draft‚Äù Works

When you write code that works, you feel successful, which puts you in a better mindset. Simple code is more likely to work the first time.

Plus, simple code is straightforward to write, saving you time. Yes, it may feel repetitious, and the clever part of your brain is going to be begging you for a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù solution with greater micro-performance in fewer lines of code.

**Ignore it.**

The trick is to sip a beverage when you get those feelings, then forge ahead in the pursuit of simplicity. Once the code works, you‚Äôre going to refactor it right away ‚Äî and you can be as clever as you want once you have a working copy. But until you get there, keep things as simple as possible.

Writing coach [August Birch](undefined) calls this ‚Äú[leapfrog writing](https://medium.com/@augustbirch/why-writing-crappy-first-drafts-is-terrible-advice-fa5d7f53cdd):‚Äù Write the whole thing, then edit it immediately. You alternate writing and editing.

Here‚Äôs where programming differs from writing, though: Developers know when the first draft is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù because the code executes successfully. When your code works, that‚Äôs your cue to immediately edit your ‚Äúsimple first draft,‚Äù polishing it up a few times before you move on.

For anyone just learning to code, this approach improves two crucial skills: writing code that works, and improving existing code without breaking it.

## A Code Example

I was recently mentoring a junior engineer via LinkedIn, and he was struggling with an overly-complicated coding challenge. While such coding challenges become less useful once you have real projects to work on, they‚Äôre a great example of how to write a ‚Äúsimple first draft.‚Äù

Since the problem was complicated, he tried to write a complicated solution. Let‚Äôs take a look at the challenge:

> ‚ÄúWrite a function `addWeirdStuff`, which adds the sum of all the odd numbers in `arrayTwo` to each element under 10 in `arrayOne`.
>
> Similarly, `addWeirdStuff` should also add the sum of all the even numbers in `arrayTwo` to those elements 10 or greater in `arrayOne`.
>
> Bonus: If any element in `arrayTwo` is greater than 20, add 1 to every element in `arrayOne`.‚Äù

Note that, just like in real life, he got incomplete instructions: The function `addWeirdStuff` is supposed to return a new array containing the items from `arrayOne` followed by the items from `arrayTwo`.

He initially tried to solve it with a single [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loop, which was setting himself up for failure. That‚Äôs a complex cognitive task guaranteed to challenge your working memory, and he was getting nowhere with it.

This particular individual had contacted me previously for help with another coding challenge where he‚Äôd accidentally put the return statement into the body of a complex [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loop. He‚Äôs not ready to write concise code just yet.

I told him that he needed to use two separate [`for`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loops and that he should make them [`for‚Ä¶of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loops for simplicity‚Äôs sake. Here‚Äôs the JavaScript code, including the tests he was given to check if the code works:

It‚Äôs ugly, and it performs poorly, but it works! And it‚Äôs super-readable, especially for a brand-new coder struggling with basic concepts.

The next step is to polish up this ‚Äúsimple first draft.‚Äù

## Time to Refactor

Refactoring, love it or hate it, is better known to writers as the editing process. In both programming and other types of writing, editing is easier when you‚Äôve written the text yourself, especially when done right away.

Use simple language in order to reduce the complexity of the text at first, and then edit immediately. It works for all types of writing, including coding.

Taking our ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù from above, I refactored to the following:

![[View the raw code](https://gist.github.com/djD-REK/a6c16202a8d2a441f1f750f883853476) as a GitHub gist](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3180/1*eVSyFkneW5d9joK4ytU2Zw.png)

This is still a challenging problem, and there are a ton of other ways to approach it, but this revision felt like a step in the right direction.

In this version of the first draft, I added [the reducer pattern](https://reedbarger.com/what-is-a-reducer-in-javascript/) because I prefer to use [functional programming](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/what-are-javascript-programming-paradigms-3ef0f576dfdb) techniques in my code.

Remember: ‚ÄúPerfect is the enemy of good.‚Äù This is just your first draft, and you can edit it again! That‚Äôs the leapfrogging process.

I‚Äôm also prioritizing readability over performance since I now call [`.some()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some) inside each iteration of a loop. That‚Äôs a loop within a loop, for [O(n¬≤)](https://medium.com/@jorgesmulevici/o-n%C2%B2-is-not-what-you-think-bb3a2a5f58b1) run-time. For small arrays, that won‚Äôt matter a bit, but it probably won‚Äôt get you that job at Google. It‚Äôs also trivial to refactor out in my next edit of this first draft.

I made one more round of changes to add the [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method before I decided I was done with my ‚Äúsimple first draft:‚Äù

![[View the raw code](https://gist.github.com/djD-REK/b93a5480e648778fd27284980e937f6b) as a GitHub gist](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3108/1*Yluuogf6Co9gsr5tTtgybw.png)

That‚Äôs a ‚Äúpolished first draft.‚Äù I‚Äôve changed two [`for‚Ä¶of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loops to a [`.reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce), a [`.some()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some), and a [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). I prefer this style of coding, but honestly, there was nothing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with my very first draft ‚Äî it worked, didn‚Äôt it?

Now, this would be a great time to switch tasks and plan to review this particular code again tomorrow.

## The Application to Real Code

In our real work, we often receive confusing instructions combined with deadline pressure, particularly when working with new APIs. Every coder wonders at times, ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt this code work the way it should?‚Äù

For the student I was mentoring, he went from being unable to conceptualize a problem to solving it easily because he started with simple [`for‚Ä¶of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loops. Instead of feeling challenged and like a failure, he was left feeling successful and accomplished, all thanks to the ‚Äúsimple first draft.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre more experienced, and writing [`.reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) the first time feels natural, go for it! But if you need to look up the syntax, see if you can do without it and then refactor to it later. In coding, you can always edit later.

Similarly, you will probably want to go back to add [type checking](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/the-best-way-to-type-check-in-vanilla-js-55197b4f45ec) if you‚Äôre working in JavaScript. For a coding challenge, that‚Äôs not going to be necessary, but that‚Äôs something to consider adding the next day.

The other real-world carryover of the ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù approach to coding is that you‚Äôll be making frequent [git commits](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-commit): at a minimum, you should commit each version of the first draft as you‚Äôre leapfrogging. You may have three or four working versions committed by the time you‚Äôve polished up the first draft.

You‚Äôll appreciate having the commits if you find a bug when working on the code later because you‚Äôll have a few solutions to review in the repository.

Plus, making commits **feels** super productive to me, especially when I‚Äôm working as part of a remote team. There‚Äôs that positive psychology again.

## What About Testing?

Depending on your personal preferences for testing, it‚Äôs totally fine to write your tests before the code. Just follow the same approach: Write the simplest tests possible, and then refactor them as soon as they work.

Or, like most programmers, you probably prefer testing after you have a working piece of code ‚Äî and that‚Äôs totally fine. After you write your code and refactor it once or twice, write some simple tests, then refactor them.

The fastest way I know to write code is to do exactly the following:

1. Write simple code
2. Write simple tests
3. Refactor simple code, using simple tests
4. Refactor simple tests

Personally, I find that focusing on a ‚Äúbad first draft‚Äù (or a ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù as I like to say) makes me much more likely to write tests in the first place because I‚Äôm not worried about writing perfect tests.

You might even consider testing to be creating a ‚Äúsecond draft‚Äù of your work and put off that task until tomorrow. Do whatever works for you, your project, and your organization ‚Äî just don‚Äôt forget about testing.

## Conclusion

Whether you‚Äôre a code newbie, junior engineer, or expert, you‚Äôre going to write more code faster if you don‚Äôt focus on perfection. Start with a ‚Äúsimple first draft‚Äù then immediately edit your code once it works.

Take it from a technical writer who‚Äôs worked with 10 programming languages professionally and written 100,000 words about JavaScript in the last year ‚Äî this writing tip works just as well for developers as for writers.

My genuine advice for programmers of all levels is that your first draft should be repetitious and even feel like a ‚Äúhack.‚Äù Forget about [coding principles](https://medium.com/dailyjs/principles-to-code-by-3c516ad61fcc) like ‚ÄúDRY‚Äù (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) at first, and stick with the most basic rule of coding:

**‚ÄúKISS‚Äù (Keep It Simple, Stupid!)**

You will be able to make your code beautiful once it works, but your whole day will be shot if you have to spend hours debugging ‚Äî before you even get that piece of code to work even one time. **Trust me, I‚Äôve been there!**

And, if you‚Äôre just learning a new programming language, development tool, or codebase, then this advice is mandatory, not optional.

Happy coding!
