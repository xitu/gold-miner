# What Makes a Good Github Profile?

When I was applying to internships in college, I definitely underrated GitHub. I coded a lot of projects in my college classes. I even had to include long-winded writeups about each project that could be easily translated into a README. But I didn’t bother to upload and maintain these projects on my GitHub profile. I quickly realized that it was a missed opportunity.

The truth is, maintaining a GitHub profile takes a lot of time and effort. Writing documentation and keeping code up-to-date when your class has moved on to the next project is extra work. However, with just a little bit more effort, that school or side project can be turned into a meaningful portfolio piece. And a portfolio is a fantastic way to stand out.

#### Which job seekers benefit from GitHub projects the most?

Entry-level applicants (college students, recent college grads, and bootcampers) benefit immensely because — due to their lack of professional tech experience — projects are what showcase their abilities best. [Experienced developers looking to transition](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/what-do-job-seeking-developers-need-their-github) can also greatly benefit from GitHub projects. A programmer who is under-challenged or forced to write in out-of-favor languages will struggle to find an employer with the latest tech stack without demonstrated experience.

In this article, I put together all the tips I gathered from college and mentors on what it takes to make a GitHub profile that boosts your job application. I am by no means a GitHub super-user, but please read on for some helpful guidelines that I welcome you to follow.

## Including a well-documented README in every repo

Documentation of your code goes a long way — not just for any users trying to use the tools, but for the recruiters & hiring managers looking at your profile. Including well-formatted documentation shows that you:

1. Have great communication skills
2. Know how to invest in a project for the long-term

In your documentation, you should include the **purpose and use cases** of your project. You should also include **installation instructions** so that users can easily run or utilize any tool or product you’ve made. Last but not least, include a **demo** (screenshots or gifs are a plus!) and/or a demo link so that users can view your work effortlessly.

## Writing clean, organized code

Being able to produce clean code is a must when working with a team. One of the biggest turnoffs for the hiring manager or team member is when they see code they would have trouble working with. Just like with the README, showing good organization in your code is a great way to impress rather than disappoint. Creating functions for duplicate code and linting your code are great practices.

Include comments in your code as needed or according to the coding language’s best practices— i.e. in Python, include [Docstrings](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1565261270&utm_adgroupid=67750485268&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=332661264374&utm_targetid=aud-299261629574:dsa-429603003980&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9033348&gclid=CjwKCAjwq_D7BRADEiwAVMDdHtPFljxXsIaMpcyiPjdYBJrUmC2oCkQw7G7bVGfHzUHwE_k-FwogHhoCqtEQAvD_BwE) in your functions. Consider [keeping your comments at a minimum](https://medium.com/better-programming/comments-in-your-code-730cfd1dde02) to reduce noise. To reduce redundant comments, be sure to select meaningful variable names and keep the code simplified if possible (try to avoid “code hacks”). Your comments should focus more on the **intent** of the code.

As a general rule, you should have a good project and file structure. For example, if you have lots of helper functions then keep them in a separate file. Write tests for your code if applicable.

## Staying active

**Goal**: You want those green squares! More green shows that you are active on the platform and are constantly making code contributions, which looks great to hiring managers.

A general rule of thumb: **update your code and commit often**. Working on a school project? Update your GitHub as you’re making progress. Having small projects is fine, but try to make them diverse to showcase different sets of skills.

**Keep your projects up to date.** As you learn, you will likely have changes or new updates you’d like to make to your older projects.

Apart from committing changes to a repository, you can make other contributions to show more activity, such as:

* Opening an issue
* Proposing a pull request
* Submitting a pull request review

Does your workplace use GitHub? You can [enable private contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/showing-an-overview-of-your-activity-on-your-profile) to show in your activity under your profile.

## Using GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great tool to use to be able to host a webpage directly from your repository. This is powerful because it allows the user to show the result of your project instantaneously. For example, if your project is a website, GitHub Pages will host your **index.html** page in just a few buttons. Furthermore, any changes you push will be reflected on the hosted page without having to deploy. Having a demo or host page for your project can be key to showing off your skills. If you’re unsure of how to host a demo, GitHub Pages is a great option to look into.

## Managing your location & profile information

To tie your profile together, you should include your professional and contact information. Recruiters use search tools to find profiles based on location, so including location allows you to be easily found. If you have a following on GitHub, these links allow you to be found on other platforms easily as well.

You can also customize your GitHub by pinning repositories. Choose the best projects that you want users to see right away.

Remember that [GitHub is not your resume](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/). To recruiters and hiring managers, a quality GitHub profile and projects are supplemental material to your application and conversation pieces for interviews. Don’t treat it as a hub for everything — keep your descriptions concise and maybe even show a little personality.

## Other tips

* Take advantage of adding a description and tags for your repositories. Keep things concise and informative.
* Stay professional and informative in your commit messages. Include something more meaningful than “fix bug” or “why won’t this work??”
* Have clear contributing guidelines if you are looking to have others contribute to your project.
* Remove clutter such as forked repositories that you haven’t worked on.

* Get involved in the community — contribute to open source projects!

## Conclusion

With these guidelines, I was able to revamp my GitHub profile to be a useful tool in my job applications. I’ve even had interviewers bring up projects in conversation. I highly recommend utilizing GitHub as a tool, whether you’re in your job search or you’re trying to maintain a good online presence. Good luck!
