# UX Case Study: KoinStreet Homepage Redesign

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11634/1*_4OaRdRVy_x_luuum4_plg.png)

## Project Introduction

**Client:** KoinStreet is a cryptocurrency trading platform that sets up copy trading systems between experienced traders and passive investors. The platform also fosters a community for those interested in learning more about cryptocurrency and also curates and creates news and educational resources for those who want to know more. 
**Task:** Redesign the [landing page ](https://www.koinstreet.com/)
**Scope:** 4 days 
**Tool:** Adobe XD

## Methodology and Timeline

**Day 1:** Heuristics analysis of KoinStreet and research into the company. Competitive and feature analysis of existing cryptocurrency platforms. 
**Day 2:** Brainstorming key features & outlining layouts on a whiteboard
**Day 3:** Sketching on paper, creating wireframes on AdobeXD, creating a moodboard using KoinStreet’s social media imagery 
**Day 4:** High-fidelity mockup of KoinStreet’s redesign on AdobeXD

#### Philosophy

For this redesign, my philosophy was to take what was already there, focus on the very best features and reassemble them into something fresh, modern, and new.

#### Goals

Create a visually stunning landing page that was **Futuristic, Bold, and Trustworthy** while giving users **clarity** on what KoinStreet had to offer.

## KoinStreet- Current Landing Page

#### Heuristics Evaluation

I started by looking through KoinStreet’s current landing page and wrote down areas for improvement and then ranked them from most serious problems to least serious problems:

1. **There were no clear steps or guidance** for how to use the site.
2. There was nothing on the landing page talking about **security.**
3. Beautiful video showing the company’s features and benefits. **However, the video mentioned some key features that were not highlighted on the landing page at all, specifically the trade copying feature.**
4. The colors, while cohesive, looked a little outdated.
5. Partners, affiliations, and community icons were very large and distracting. In addition, the banners for partners and affiliations was not centered.

#### Competitive Analysis

After studying KoinStreet’s landing page, I looked at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Luno](https://www.luno.com/en/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en?ref=16626703), and [Paxful](https://paxful.com/#) to study their landing pages.

From observing and studying these competitors, I wrote down strong features that were missing from KoinStreet’s website (specifically features that increased clarity about the website’s features and increased feelings of security and trust) to prepare for some brainstorming and outlining.

## Starting to Design

After developing a more thorough understanding of KoinStreet, cryptocurrency, and competitors in the field, I started the brainstorming and sketching process.

#### Brainstorming and Outlining

I started by writing down features that needed to be included in KoinStreet’s new landing page in order to increase clarity in understanding KoinStreet’s features and increase feelings of trust in users.

Afterwards, I outlined some possible methods of organization for the new landing page.

Then, I moved into some more detailed sketches of how the landing page could be organized. The sketch on the right is the closest to what the final product ended up looking like.

#### Moodboard

During the sketching process, I also created a moodboard using KoinStreet’s imagery on Twitter, Facebook, Medium, and Instagram.

I did this for several reasons:

* To get a sense of how KoinStreet was already visually presenting itself to its audience
* To ensure that KoinStreet’s redesign had some cohesion and connections to its existing social platforms
* To see how far we could push the redesign while staying true to its roots

#### Wireframe

Next, I made a very simple wireframe of the landing page that helped inform the order and spacing for the content.

## Final Product

This is a finished, high-fidelity mockup of KoinStreet’s landing page.

I used KoinStreet’s banner from Medium.com to create a new color scheme and focused on making sure KoinStreet’s features and benefits were clearly stated.

## Next Steps

* User testing and user research to find out more about what people familiar with cryptocurrency would want to see from this redesign
* Getting client feedback to see what they want to incorporate
* Build out the About and Blog sections
