# The World Needs Web Accessibility Now More Than Ever

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2158/1*fM91JgfWigiKGZLA5hYC5w.jpeg)

I attended a talk last year by [Mike Gifford](https://openconcept.ca/users/mike) where he said, “the web has actually become LESS accessible since 2011.”

It’s cheap and easy for anyone to create a website these days, and hardly anyone considers accessibility. And why would you? If it’s not in your daily purview, it’s not going into your list of website requirements. Heck, most people don’t even think of the end user, Disabled or not, when creating a website. Especially not when they use a “drag and drop” style website creation platform. Nothing against those, just that those platforms often don’t have accessibility built in, and it’s very difficult to make them so, even if you had the desire.

The other aspect working against website accessibility is when you say the word, ‘accessibility’ not every even has a concept of what that means. I asked a website designer recently if he makes accessible websites, and he said, “yes…we add alt-tags to all our images.” Ummmm, OK. Great. But can a screen reader read your website?

So let’s dispel some myths and dive a bit into the world of what it means to implement web accessibility.

First off, it’s important to note that the USA actually has very clear legislation regarding accessibility. It’s called the Americans With Disabilities Act, and it includes websites. US-based companies should be aware that not having a minimally accessible business website can leave you open to a law suit and fines. I’m Canadian with a Canadian registered company, so I do not actually have to worry about getting sued for not having an accessible website, but bonus, I have one anyway! I’ll explain why it’s beneficial to have an accessible website even if you are not a US-based company.

A little reminder when people are concerned about the trouble or potential cost of creating an accessible website is that [accessibility benefits everyone](https://medium.com/@kbronjohn_2775/accessibility-makes-everyones-life-easier-98af7efaea4e). If we get down to the nitty gritty, we know 22% of Canadians have a disability of some sort (18% in the USA), and without doing the math, that’s a lot of people. **A lot of people who want to shop online, buy your products, learn about your services, or take your online classes**. Disabled people have been connected online, breaking isolation, and working remotely for years before the pandemic hit. This is old hat for us. So now that the pandemic lockdown has given everyone some insight into what it’s like to be stuck at home (lots of online shopping, educational webinars, arts and entertainment), maybe we can all appreciate how important being able to access the web easily actually is.

Like I said, accessibility makes everyone’s life easier, and if you’re trying to make a business case for it, you’re not just creating a website for that 18–22% of the population; you should be thinking about the whole population. **Do you want to limit the amount of potential customers you can attract?** It would be like having a physical store and saying, ‘I don’t actually want people to come in and shop here. I think they should go to the competitor’. Which is your prerogative, and your business, and of course there are many reasons a business may choose to filter their clients from the get-go. **However, I’m speaking specifically about creating barriers for people who otherwise would be your target customer, but you’ve shut the door on them inadvertently**.

With all of that out of the way, let’s look at what web accessibility really entails. It all comes down to user-experience and you want everyone to have the best and most positive experience with your brand.

To be accessible, website visitors should, **at a minimum**, be able to do a few key things:

* browse your website in the language they prefer
* change the font style or font size
* change the background contrast
* navigate the site using a screen reader
* navigate the site without the use of a mouse
* turn off/stop any music, video, or rotating picture carousels
* know what a link contains before clicking on it
* have captions on any videos contained on the site
* hear accurate and relevant image descriptions on pictures or icons
* have colourblind friendly colours on any graphs or important images

This is just a start, but it should be a nice jumping point. Again, thinking about the end user first, and realizing that your end users have a variety of needs. **Also, test your site with real people** (and pay them). Yes, there are simulators and there are sites where you can input your website URL and it gives you a score, but having real feedback from real users will give you valuable insight that is priceless. Gather a focus group of people from different age groups, people with different Disabilities, and different backgrounds, and take their opinions seriously. I guarantee you will create an excellent experience and build a positive reputation for your brand.

Not to mention, search engines will rank your site higher if it has clear and easy navigation. What is good for people is good for search engine robots. It’s a win-win!

Look at web accessibility as opening doors for new clients, new relationships, satisfied customers, and increased profits. Also, it’s just the right thing to do.
